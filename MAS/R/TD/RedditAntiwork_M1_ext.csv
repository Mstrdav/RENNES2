I KNOW someone here is a **print broker or sign maker** with an account at 4over, Stouse, etc. Please DM me.

Also, if you have an online store through 4over or some other ordering platform that we could use for people to order these products and you’re willing to sell them, let me know.

If someone wants to write up brief instructions on safely distributing these, that would help.

We need a **graphic designer** experienced in preprint production.

My work doesn't offer any maternity leave.... Hers does

House is 160k at 870/mo

Health insurance + dental+ eye is running me and the kid 600/mo mom is solo at 280/mo (cheaper than a family plan)

Car insurance is ~300 for year for me idk hers

We haven't got to daycare yet. I work 3rds she's on days that's how we're going to be doing it when her leave ends.

My truck 2013 is paid off but her car payment on a 2019 is 380/mo

I'd say 300-600/mo for food. Higher being for when we host the Thanksgiving or Christmas. 

Internet 75 for 1gig up/down
cell phones 175 (could be cheaper but we are in rural)
250~ electric
360-960/year for house gas


Im at new job only at 32k a year I'm severely under paid compared to the supervisor spot making 60-78k.

Never under any circumstances go to the clearance clothing section and take the price stickers that mark clothing down and put them on better, more expensive, clothing, shoes, or whatever; that's theft! Walmart has worked hard to generate the profits they have and even if that profit is made with their heels to the throats of their employees it gives you zero right to steal or print out fliers for local unionization and union reps to leave in the bathrooms for employees to read when they attempt to catch a small break from their living hell.

Being a food plant there are a huge number of federal sanitation protocols. Not to mention being the whole plant is grain based, the whole process top to bottom has to be modified by skilled experienced workers to compensate for differences in moisture/quality of the grain. Even more so with wheat, as wheat has to be tempered with heat/water prior to processing to ensure the germ/bran/endosperm split the right way. 

I run a 60 ton/hr soy mill that feeds the rest of our entire plant. It takes at minimum 6 - 8 WEEKS to get someone to a skill level they can babysit, with supervision, a grain mill like Kelloggs. Even someone simple like keeping their raw grain elevators full would take weeks to train someone for.

Every day our numbers grow stronger and so does our resolve, resources, and collective intelligence. Every single one of you are changing the world. Even if you haven't quit your job, haven't unionized, haven't even asked for a raise. Just simply being here, discussing your work conditions is helping people both young and old realize that they are being exploited. That things weren't always this way in the US, and that things can change if we want them to. They can't ignore 1,300,000 of our voices crying out in unison for change.

We have come across long way from antiwork being a place to vent about your boss. We have become a collective of people across the country, across industries, and across income levels. We have become something that those who own you are starting to be afraid of. But we still have a long way to go before we cross our finish line. Its time we start calling this what it is, a general union of laborers and consumers. I think we need to start formally addressing companies as such. We simply state our grievances with a company, and if they don't address those, we, the r/antiwork community, will fuck you up. We will contact your employees and encourage strikes, we can go so far as to even support striking employees via crowdsourcing. We will boycott your products, and we will prevent you from hiring new/replacement employees. The most crucial part of this actions are concentrated effort, attainable goals, and companies we stand a fighting chance with (I think we can take on 1000-1500 employee companies all the live long day). Its easy to shout ""we want universal Healthcare for everyone right now!"", but these guy are going to shrug us off. We need to set goals like COLAs, wages, time off, and other benefits like tuition, child/elder care, and achievable in-company performance bonuses for all departments and work our way up the food chain until we get not only what we we deserve, but pay for. This is truly what the owner class fears most.

As we grow larger and more effective in our efforts we must keep in mind the attention we will attract. Not just from monied corporations who want to break us, but from political adversaries and even the government. It seems like the CIAs main job is cracking socialist skulls and they've done a damn good job of it so far, domestically and abroad. Because if this, I move that we implement some r/antiwork member requirements like account age, karma amounts, and even community interactions that might be of concern. I know that this slows our member count but it increases the quality or likelihood a genuine person owns that account. Bot farms exist because they are effective.

If you schedule under a wrong a code, the inspectors just simply won't go out instead of switching the code to the proper one). I'm not even mad at the new guy who made the mistake, I'm only 6 months in and I make mistakes still. 

She starts calling me stupid, how we can't do our jobs properly, how incompetent we are, and she's going on and on until I transfered her to my supervisor (who I'm LUCKY if they're available anyway, sometimes they just dick off for a bit and don't answer their phone)

But NO, I was assumed to be a 'flight risk' or my job gap meant I was hiding something. Companies and recruiters (the ones that didn't blow me off) saw me as someone to exploit when they realized I was broke and desperate.

Honesty will not reward you in corporate America. Just lie about job gaps on your resume, then be honest once you have your foot in the door at the interview. You will get absolutely nowhere otherwise. Ask me how I know. Job gaps have had 0 impact on my ability to do good work relavant to my field.

At the time I took any job I could. I didn't have the option to consider red flags. I will never forget what I put up with when I worked in cable because I was broke and desperate:

-Micromanaging boss that expected 7 repair visits in a single 8 hour workday. How he gaslit and blamed me when *anything* went wrong (and I was so mentally broken to just believe him).

-Servicing a home, then later seeing cockroaches start coming out of the cable box in my hands that I'm reclaiming.

-Being called on my work cell multiple times because I'm taking too long at a job site... because I'm being meticulous as I'm LITERALLY DRILLING A HOLE through a customer's wall to connect to an outside dmarc. 

-The anxiety and panic attacks I experienced in my work van.

-The customer that wanted to literally fight me because I couldn't complete his repair that same day due to circumstances out of my control.

-The coworker that visited one of my job sites to document every. Single. Mistake. I made after working a full day with no breaks so he could throw me under the bus to my abusive boss.

-Hoarder homes.

-Home completely covered in bird shit inside because the guy had a free roaming pet dove. 

-Management threatening to write me up for being legitamately sick and needing a sick day.

I will never forget how my ""first IT job"" acted like they were doing me a huge favor ""rescuing"" me from that toxic work environment when in reality they were significantly underpaying me in a different kind of toxic enviorn. ""Great company culture"" and a 4pm Friday beer do not pay bills. ""We're a family here.""

NONE of that stuff I described above would fly with me today. You can't exploit people with options and savings. Why is there a noticeable 'anti-work' movement now? Because people like me have been guilted and gas-lit for years to think the problem is themselves instead of our hyper competitive post-2008 recession job market that punishes honesty and demands unrealistic effort and loyalty from workers while paying less and less, while seeing these same companies post the same vapid, fake motivational trash on Linkedin as they always have. I will live out of my car again before I go back to being underpaid by a terrible company. Ubereats pays me better than what I made above.

Good workplaces are out there and I am in a much better place mentally, career, and financially in 2021. No one deserves what I went through to put food on the table and pay the bills. I know my worth and no longer care about my ""professional reputation."" Reddit.com/r/antiwork"	"2021-12-10 19:18:40"

A job interview is an opportunity for both parties to determine if the job seeker is a good fit for the position. The organization is determining if the candidate is qualified and the candidate is determining if they are even interested in that specific position and if the company is a good place to work etc. 

A phone screen….is not that. 

Twice now I have asked specific questions about the positions I’ve applied for and been told by the phone screener that “The hiring manager could answer that question in the next round of interviews.” What??? I’m not sure I even want to make it to the next round of interviews if you can’t even tell me how many clients the position is expected to serve (phone screen 1) or describe more specifically the job duties or culture of the work team (phone screen 2). 

Like I said, I understand the purpose of the phone screen but the disparity of power is starting to feel a little unfair. My time is just as valuable as the hiring managers."	"2021-12-10 19:13:10"

# Pre-industrial workers had a shorter workweek than today's

from *The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure*, by Juliet B. Schor

        and: [Eight centuries of annual hours](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/hours_workweek.html#hours)

*The labouring man will take his rest long in the morning; a good piece of the day is spent afore he come at his work; then he must have his breakfast, though he have not earned it at his accustomed hour, or else there is grudging and murmuring; when the clock smiteth, he will cast down his burden in the midway, and whatsoever he is in hand with, he will leave it as it is, though many times it is marred afore he come again; he may not lose his meat, what danger soever the work is in. At noon he must have his sleeping time, then his bever in the afternoon, which spendeth a great part of the day; and when his hour cometh at night, at the first stroke of the clock he casteth down his tools, leaveth his work, in what need or case soever the work standeth.*  
        \-James Pilkington, Bishop of Durham, ca. 1570

One of capitalism's most durable myths is that it has reduced human toil. This myth is typically defended by a comparison of the modern forty-hour week with its seventy- or eighty-hour counterpart in the nineteenth century. The implicit -- but rarely articulated -- assumption is that the eighty-hour standard has prevailed for centuries. The comparison conjures up the dreary life of medieval peasants, toiling steadily from dawn to dusk. We are asked to imagine the journeyman artisan in a cold, damp garret, rising even before the sun, laboring by candlelight late into the night.

These images are backward projections of modern work patterns. And they are false. Before capitalism, most people did not work very long hours at all. The tempo of life was slow, even leisurely; the pace of work relaxed. Our ancestors may not have been rich, but they had an abundance of leisure. When capitalism raised their incomes, it also took away their time. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that working hours in the mid-nineteenth century constitute the most prodigious work effort in the entire history of humankind.

Therefore, we must take a longer view and look back not just one hundred years, but three or four, even six or seven hundred. Consider a typical working day in the medieval period. It stretched from dawn to dusk (sixteen hours in summer and eight in winter), but, as the Bishop Pilkington has noted, work was intermittent - called to a halt for breakfast, lunch, the customary afternoon nap, and dinner. Depending on time and place, there were also midmorning and midafternoon refreshment breaks. These rest periods were the traditional rights of laborers, which they enjoyed even during peak harvest times. During slack periods, which accounted for a large part of the year, adherence to regular working hours was not usual. According to Oxford Professor James E. Thorold Rogers\[1\], the medieval workday was not more than eight hours. The worker participating in the eight-hour movements of the late nineteenth century was ""simply striving to recover what his ancestor worked by four or five centuries ago.""

An important piece of evidence on the working day is that it was very unusual for servile laborers to be required to work a whole day for a lord. One day's work was considered half a day, and if a serf worked an entire day, this was counted as two ""days-works.""\[2\] Detailed accounts of artisans' workdays are available. Knoop and jones' figures for the fourteenth century work out to a yearly average of 9 hours (exclusive of meals and breaktimes)\[3\]. Brown, Colwin and Taylor's figures for masons suggest an average workday of 8.6 hours\[4\].

The contrast between capitalist and precapitalist work patterns is most striking in respect to the working year. The medieval calendar was filled with holidays. Official -- that is, church -- holidays included not only long ""vacations"" at Christmas, Easter, and midsummer but also numerous saints' andrest days. These were spent both in sober churchgoing and in feasting, drinking and merrymaking. In addition to official celebrations, there were often weeks' worth of ales -- to mark important life events (bride ales or wake ales) as well as less momentous occasions (scot ale, lamb ale, and hock ale). All told, holiday leisure time in medieval England took up probably about one-third of the year. And the English were apparently working harder than their neighbors. The *ancien règime* in France is reported to have guaranteed fifty-two Sundays, ninety rest days, and thirty-eight holidays. In Spain, travelers noted that holidays totaled five months per year.\[5\]

The peasant's free time extended beyond officially sanctioned holidays. There is considerable evidence of what economists call the backward-bending supply curve of labor -- the idea that when wages rise, workers supply less labor. During one period of unusually high wages (the late fourteenth century), many laborers refused to work ""by the year or the half year or by any of the usual terms but only by the day."" And they worked only as many days as were necessary to earn their customary income -- which in this case amounted to about 120 days a year, for a probable total of only 1,440 hours annually (this estimate assumes a 12-hour day because the days worked were probably during spring, summer and fall). A thirteenth-century estime finds that whole peasant families did not put in more than 150 days per year on their land. Manorial records from fourteenth-century England indicate an extremely short working year -- 175 days -- for servile laborers. Later evidence for farmer-miners, a group with control over their worktime, indicates they worked only 180 days a year.

A year has elapsed and our company’s compensation department has said that I actually need 8 years of experience in order to qualify for this job title since my degree is not in the field in which I’m working. LOL! Bear in mind that I’m one of the top producers on my team and I’m already doing the job. 

This job is a computer job, nothing that requires a specialty of ANY sort, if you can produce the work. For instance, say I’m a graphic designer, able to produce a myriad of graphic design projects, but don’t have a degree in graphic design. This company I work for, wants to call me a design associate instead of a graphic designer, therefore paying me about 25% less than the actual job role.

So I work in a small bakery as a baker. I am already going through carpal tunnel syndrome because of my job. When I was leaving work two days ago, I bent down to put on my shoes and my right knee cracked, and started hurting. I really don't like calling out of work so I got up and painfully clocked out and walked to my car. Later on that night, I was cleaning the floor and bent down again to pick something up. My knee did the same exact thing and this time I was in excruciating pain. I tried to get up but the pain was so bad that I fell to the floor. Once I tried to get up, I couldn't walk properly! So anyways, I called out yesterday and today. I am still new to the job and it is hectic around this time of the year but I couldn't even walk up and down the stairs without help.

Of course I have marketplace insurance and couldn't pay it for the past two months so I couldn't even be seen at the doctor's office yesterday. I plan on going back today because I asked my bf for money. 

So now I feel like a failure and I know that my co-workers at this small knit bakery will probably be gossiping about me. Heck, I was wincing in pain at a very visible spot when my knee first gave out and no one asked if I was okay. I honestly don't know how to feel and would love to know what you guys think about all this. Much love ❤"	"2021-12-10 19:03:16"

We're appearing more and more in the public eye and eventually they'll start to crack down. 

Sounds extreme but remember the Wallstreetbets subreddit.

We need to stay peaceful but ask for the most change.

We need to take everything posted on here with the utmost scrutiny.

We need to stay on guard.

And most importantly. We need to stay United.

Don't feel complacent, even when they give us what we ask of, and they will, we cannot see it as enough.

Even in those ""golden times"" where minimum wage was livable wage, that's not enough.

Our end goal should always stay the same.

Antiwork. 

It doesn't mean ""freeloading"", or ""Lazy"".

It means the freedom to do what we want. That doesn't mean no teachers or bin workers. There is always someone who will want to fill the roles. 

Give any living being everything they need to live and more and they'll want to do ""work"", they'll want to do ""unskilled labour"".

Because if that wasn't true we would not be here. Money is not something that existed at the start. We compromised and lived as a team, that's why over 250,000 years we are at this point.

Don't negate any of that.

Don't act as though money needs to exist.

For now we'll compromise. But we do this for the next generation, and the ones after them, and the ones after them.

What we lay here could change how work valued.

Am I blowing it out of proportion? Some could say so but is it really out of proportion. 

When you see a man with more money that the combined wealth of 98 percent of the population. (Because yes. It is that extreme) Cannot even give the ones creating that wealth a thriving wage. No scratch that, a survivable wage.

Put on the fact that there are more than 30 people with more wealth than 95 percent of the population. 

Individually.

Homelessness is still a thing that exist!??? Genuinely grasp the fact that we have more than enough homes to accommodate. 

So many issues that have developed more and more as the wage inequality increases.

You look at who were alive 1000 years past and think outdated, foolish. 

So what does that make the us that is now.

The us that is still facing issues that have only gotten worse despise us creating them in the first place.

It was always the people who made the rules, and they've made us believe we are the ones hold no power.



Antiwork. Remember, we hold the power. We the people, who create the money in the first place. Who make society work in the first place. Never forgot. And always ask for more. Stay peaceful, and stay angry.

If you've read all of that and thought, well that sounds a bit much don't it? Then even you are still brainwashed by our society. It has always been this extreme. What's extreme is there is a human living with nothing but the cold frost on their nose. And there is a man with more money and riches and luxury that no other being other than him can fathom."

So, I don’t know where to start. My boss asked me “are you [redacted]?” The other day and I didn’t say anything in response. Today, he came up to me and told me to do some shit I couldn’t do. I told him so and he snapped and went off and I told him I don’t like the way he treats me and that I especially don’t like that he called me [redacted]. He FLIPPED and said I’m a liar and that he did not *call* me this word, he *asked* if I am and therefore, I am a liar and need to leave. 

He called my other coworker into the room to tell him I’m being fired and a 15 minute convo, WHICH I RECORDED!!!!, ensued where I explained that he’s basically a big racist, sexist, ableist bully and that he needs to have more respect for his workers and that his business has no structure. 

I don’t know what to do. It’s Christmas time, I have bills to pay and presents to buy and animals to feed. I don’t know where to turn right now but I’m furious and I have the convo afterwards recorded where he admitted he asked me if I’m redacted, but said it was a joke. 

For context, I do office work and live in Southeast Michigan. I will not name the company yet for legal reasons as I don’t know what I’m going to do yet.

If anyone is a lawyer, I would love to hear your opinion. I also don’t want to post or send out the recording yet for legal reasons if there is some sort of case here.

Further context: this morning, I had a bad feeling about everything, so I went through and found every racist email I could find in his inbox and took a picture of it!

The instructions are written in Word, and there are about five different sets of instructions for different parts of the projects, and while some of the more vague instructions only have 20 pages, the major parts have almost 500 pages that need to be reviewed.

There are constant questions almost everyday about how to handle certain situations because the instructions are so vague on what to do, and the leaders of the project sometimes give conflicting answers.

I found this sub relatively recently and thought my story might be appreciated here. 10-ish years ago, I was hired to develop process improvement tools (websites/databases/etc.) for different business units. Side note: two months into my time there, real estate decisions were made, eliminating my building and I'm converted to 100% remote work (nice!). Anyway, after about one year on the job, I had cleared my project queue and nothing else was really coming down the pike. The majority of my days were then spent on minor maintenance since most of the tools I built needed a bit of monthly/quarterly/yearly maintenance to stay in good working order. I also handled the status reporting of the processes that these tools were used for. So, one year in and all I'm doing is basic maintenance and running reports. With some extra time on my hands, I figured ""why not process-improve my own job?"". So, for about 8 weeks, I hammered out mountains of scripts, queries, imports, exports and report generation that completely automated my job. I even wrote scripts to automatically e-mail the reports out for me. 

Fast forward two years.  Everything is going great, I'm doing almost zero work yet I'm getting amazing reviews, raises and large bonuses each year. I've moved my PlayStation into my office so I can play video games all day while I stay close enough to my work computer to see if any messages or e-mails come in. I start to get bored though. I'm literally playing video games and watching YouTube 38 hours a week. I can't go out and do stuff since I need to be near my work computer in case someone needs something. One day, I have one of my normal bi-weekly 1-on-1s with my manager and tell them that I have a good amount of capacity to take on some work. Well, nothing came of it, so I mentioned it one more time in a subsequent 1-on-1 and still nothing came of it. I'm not going to keep asking. So, for about six additional years, I basically got paid almost 6 figures to play video games, watch YouTube and scroll through Reddit.

Now fast-forward to spring of 2021. This company went out of their way to let everyone know that they're not laying off \*anyone\* during the pandemic because ""they care"" or some shit. So, what did they do? Of course they laid off hundreds of people in my area (me included) once it seemed like the pandemic was beginning to wane. So, while they technically kept their word...they just held their layoff plans until they thought it was less damaging to their reputation. Overall, I didn't care. I needed a change of scenery and something to challenge me again and I found a new job I really like making a lot more money to boot. 

Folks, you don't owe your employer anything. Take whatever you can get from them and give back the bare minimum. They won't hesitate to lay you off to increase their stock price a penny. We're all easily replaceable, right?

tl:dr - I automated all of my job duties, worked about 30 minutes/day and got paid for almost a decade until they laid me off during Covid."	"2021-12-10 18:51:11"
"349"	7	6	"This just happened so I'm still sitting at my desk quite shocked, but mostly confused. (Just venting)

I work in corporate, so its quite normal to have chit chat during out shifts, especially if we're spending 8-9 hours at our desks. For context, I had a great year-end performance review, just wrapped up my last one-on-one with my manager of the year, and all is well. We're looking to finish the year off strong, etc.

Till I get a teams message asking me to pop back into his office and I'm wondering if he has another assignment for me.

Turns out, he heard from his boss' boss (executive level) that I was having too casual of a conversation with my colleague (just one specific person) and that in the future, I should refrain from keeping them too long, and just keep it brief and professional. I'm initially confused at first, thinking about all the things I don't talk about at work and what I could've possibly said to set this off. After deliberating with said colleague, we found out that this exec has a reputation of wanting people just to bury their heads in their desk and work and refrain from ALL conversations with fellow colleagues. He's also been grumpy and moody lately, so I guess I'm the first one in sight to complain about. Which is so counter productive. What's worse is that I sit outside of this exec's office and all he had to do was tell me he wanted a word with me. Instead, he chooses to tell his direct report, to tell his direct report, to tell me. Booyah.

I shouldn't be surprised since we've been fully return to office since the peak of the pandemic. He believes that anyone who wants to WFH is a lazy lard and will clock you from 9am - 5:30pm. Meaning he will have his EA take attendance at 9am and clock everyone to be here till 5:30pm. We're underpaid 30% of market rate and didn't even get raises last year, and don't hope to get one this year either. If this isn't a sweat shop, idk what is.

I have a ton of interviews lined up, hopefully something will work out for me. This company is so outdated, average tenure is 2 years, if even that. They're having a hard time hiring, and everyone is dropping like flies. Yet they made this position sound so attractive a year ago. What a joke!"	"2021-12-10 18:50:33"

A new one came up this morning, it seems that released prisoners and recent parolees are the new catchphrase for solving the economic woes brought on by the great resignation. If companies would hire more parolees they would have a captive labor force that can be exploited for as long as that individual is on parole. The conversation went on to say that the employer wouldn't have to worry about the workforce quitting because each parolee is required by law to be employed to maintain their freedom. I have never heard such bullshit in my life. Ffs, take care of your employees or shut the doors, relying on a captive workforce, young folks and senior citizens to accept shit wages to make and sell your widgets is unacceptable.

Some context for my story- I live in a quiet, rural area that desperately relies on 3-4 months of heavy tourist traffic. A resort town, if you will. For the rest of the year, it's pretty well expected that business hours will reduce drastically and employees will take time off to recuperate, and it actually works pretty well for everyone. Most people get end of season bonuses, and for the businesses that close off-season, their people receive unemployment and typically return to work when it's time to reopen.

""Nobody wants to work anymore."" Everybody's sick of hearing it. When I asked my boss pre-season what we were going to do for staffing and training before we got hit, that's what they said. My first 60 hour week, I asked again. I can't keep this up for months, we're open 90 hours a week, there are only two of us trained up front, I can't do this while managing 14 pages of inventory, I said. ""Nobody to hire, nobody wants to work."" I'd taken two calls that day from applicants, following up. I give my notice, ""I may just not show up one day. This is your warning.""

My first 75 hour week, I reschedule a doctor's appointment. I'd requested the day off no less than 4 times, up to 4 weeks before. 2 weeks later, I missed a family reunion. 3 weeks after that, I missed a wedding. ""Nobody wants to work."" My spouse resets my joints for me each night when I get home, asking why I'm doing this to myself, watching my employer allow this. ""It won't be this way forever,"" I tell him.

850 hours in under 12 weeks.

""I'm taking time off,"" I said. ""Yes, I know I'm the only one up front. No, I don't care. I'm tired, and I have things to catch up on.""
They say, ""can't. Need you up front.""
""You misunderstand. I'm. Taking.""

My first few days at home were productive, but I spent the last few drunk and dreading my return. Took another month of 50 hour weeks before I finally gathered myself up in front of my boss. ""I quit months ago. I'm following up now. Here are the projects I'll be completing in the next 2 weeks.""

Wouldn't you know it, I spent my last week training a new hire. How bout that"	"2021-12-10 18:46:22"

Our great great ancestors fought for their land and rights.

They overthrew corrupt forms of power by force and numbers.

Our ancestors demanded freedom and prosperity, and they got it.

But now all of that corruption has come full circle again.

Only this time we live in some “civilized age” where acts of violence or rebellion are seen as forms of illegal activity that nobody dare do.

It just surprises me how things were a long long time ago. The things people could achieve, how little power governments really had in comparison to everyday likeminded people.

Nowadays the government figured it out.

They figured out how to keep the average person docile, working for them, and keeping that cycle going by procreating new pawns.

They invested in the military and police.

They created a vast system of sets and rules that everyone is taught to follow by the time they can walk.

We’re fucking drones. Literal drones.

Look down at a city when you’re up in an airplane.

See the thousands of cars flocking to and from work on the expressway like little worker ants.

Suppress the insanity with sex, drugs, liquor, and other bad habits.

Go to school go into large amounts of debt, entrapment.

Get married have kids, entrapment.

Barely make it working 40+ hours a week, entrapment.

Entrapment designed to keep you profiting the system as long as you need to tend to these problems.

>You mention the military industrial complex is trillions” plural. The US military budget is measured In billions not trillions.

The budget is counted in billions but the cost is trillions... I think you are being super nit picky there. 

>Pharma is ~10% of US health spending and also measures in billions. The only thing the US budget measures in trillions is social security (1..1 trillion) and healthcare if you add up Medicare and Medicaid ~1.2 trillion (ok this is cheating).

You do realise that billions annual cost is trillions if enough year passes? Are you OK?

>You seem to rant that there’s inefficiencies but some of your examples are odd. Stock trades in the US are pretty much free (yes deal flow gets sold), so claiming that there’s tons of inefficiency in the stonk markets Design is weird. Every major broker offers free trades at this point. T+2 settlement kinda sucks but we are supposed to go to T+1 by 2024 is my understanding.

Why do you need to go through a broker? That's the inefficiency and there is a margin there that you are ignoring. Also nothing is free, you just don't understand the cost yet. That's how Facebook and Google make their money. Brokers do the same through by gaining your trade information. 

>Banking is inefficient? Like I would call out consumer fee abuse and all kinds of things wrong with banking but efficiencies have massively improved in recent years. Mobile access, Cheques deposits, apps for 99% of transactions, free ATMs commonly offered.

Banking is relatively more efficient these days I grant you.

congratulations on your new promotion to... drumroll please... ""unemployed"" 😂 it's a request there's no law stating that a company has to approve it - and if filing unemployment... good luck they will probably deny you benefits because you had the choice and sound like you would be fired if didn't show and didn't request off in time

this shits normal and its hella fucking hilarious because this is called a ""request"" for a reason - again they have no obligation to approve the request - even if you did apply last year for this year and make you trade your Lamborghini in for a 7 color paint job 1980s Toyota with 3 wheels - all because you went from Microsoft to McDonald's and ordered yourself the ""McHomeless Live-under-a-bridge"" special

This lesson is sponsored by $10 bottles of the shittiest vodka known to man and 3+ month old clothes stankin like piss and ballsweat - fr though for holidays for future reference - want at least 3 weeks to a month+ in advance notice - ngl when the yearly request offs come around - they made us figure shit out who was doing what - who drew straws for Valentine's, St. Patrick's, 4th of July, Labor Day, Memorial Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas & more

the more experienced people didn't have a choice and some were needed 100% as worked in a deli & several restaurants - so we have drawn straws and yes, there were people that didn't show up - idk for me - 40m, single, no fam/kids - it's easy and I love holiday bonus pay - I also like strippers and cocaine and that bonus helps afford ""a good night"" - and what? most places close early on holidays

some don't and I get that, but literally the overtime & holiday pay is worth it - was getting $25 an hour to slice ham & swiss or roast beef and provolone/mozzarella to make someone's uncle shut the fuck up for 15 minutes

and trust me you wanted him to stfu don't lie bc gave you the fucking ""golf channel put you to sleep"" monotone Christopher-Walken-voice stories ""remember when I did this shit I been telling you the same story for 20+ years?"" and every year it gets 3x longer and 28.93% more boring

idk long story short - you could spend a couple hours with family that you will see more the rest of the year than a few hours on a holiday OR you could end up homeless or scrambling couch fishing trying to make the next month's rent money and looking for a new job

there's that rare chance that ""eh well they didn't come in, but so and so is worth it and won't hold it against them"" - if they come to terms ""the other 364 days a year we fucking need that person"" - but mostly it's ""oh you need off & 'it's not my job' (I watched someone pull this shit once) -- ""oh that's right, it's not your job, go clock the fuck out, it's not your job anymore"" lmao I died right there

but fr if you get good at your job and work the holidays and get that bonus pay for holiday hours - the shit literally pays a week's worth of bills for one day's worth of work - another buddy of mine was a manager at FedEx, pulling in over $1500 @ $30+ an hour + company holiday bonus check for $250-500 - and Christmas gift sending paid his bills for 2 months off 1 day of work basically - and I get that not every employer pays the same or offers similar benefits - I also understand others have gf/wife/kids/family

single people have families too - your family should understand if one fucking night of work pays triple what you normally make and literally 2 good holiday checks for 2-3 days pays well over a month's worth of bills and puts bigger presents under the tree and maybe it makes Uncle Rick stink up the bathroom

it's either that or Uncle Rick could be homeless stinking up underneath some bridge smellin like shitty vodka and your gf/wife has that fucking Louis Vuitton purse & pretty dresses and makeup or not - or maybe you and the kids like sleeping in the car and not in a bed? idk your choice but yep most places aren't giving a fuck with 2 weeks to go til Christmas and would say the same shit I would ""Adios, better luck at McDonalds"" when you no call no show to ""have Christmas off"""	"2021-12-11 11:49:32"

Re reading it, I’m not sure if you are after a bunch of business partners or a group of people to share your profits with who aren’t invested financially?

I see you will share all ‘takings and expenses’ which is basically profit or a loss once all is balanced. What I’m saying is as a growing business you would need to up your expenses and not expect an immediate jump in takings, see it as buying a new coffee machine or a new or bigger cool room as you grow. You will eventually pay those off but it will take time. In the meantime it would mean your “profits” are actually sitting in the shop as “plant and equipment” and that could be seen as you tricking your staff who thought they would have profit to share in.

"526"	1	0	"> A “banner test” is conducted to test a train crew’s compliance with Restricted Speed.  Restricted Speed is a speed that will permit stopping within one-half the range of vision.  It will also permit stopping short of a train, a car, an obstruction, a stop signal, a derail or an improperly lined switch.  It must permit looking out for broken rail.  It will not exceed 15 MPH.  To conduct this test, a trainmaster will place an obstruction (sometimes called a “banner”) on the track ahead of a train that is required to proceed at restricted speed on a main track.  The obstruction is large enough (with reflective tape for night tests) for a train crew to see in plenty of time to stop their train.  Similar tests are conducted in yards, where locomotive movement may not exceed 10 MPH.

Any asshole who says they have the best idea to solve these problems is being a dumbass and a charlatan. I like the idea of testing UBI and see what happens to society on small scale and then slowly adopt it that's why I said that UBI was an option.

I feel like with the fall of imperialism and ww2 and USSR, societies have become risk adverse towards experimenting with social systems. While that was fine prior to automation, it's not going to last forever. At some point AI and automation WILL push workers out. We needed to find ways to adapt to the radical change that it will bring.

UBI is just one of those ways to transition into a ""workless"" environment. Not the only one. But the conversation should always be about transition rather than revolution.

"587"	0	0	"?  Are you unaware that James Madison is ""The Father of the Constitution?""

https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/father-of-the-constitution-is-born

>Madison is best remembered for his critical role in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, where he presented the Virginia Plan to the assembled delegates in Philadelphia and oversaw the difficult process of negotiation and compromise that led to the drafting of the final Constitution. 

The guy who wrote ""Democracy bad; republic superior.""  

Really, this is a very weird hill to die on.

Maybe this will help clear it up?

https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinnkin5.html

> In Federalist Paper #10, James Madison argued that representative government was needed to maintain peace in a society ridden by factional disputes. These disputes came from ""the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society."" The problem, he said, was how to control the factional struggles that came from inequalities in wealth. Minority factions could be controlled, he said, by the principle that decisions would be by vote of the majority.

>So the real problem, according to Madison, was a majority faction, and here the solution was offered by the Constitution, to have ""an extensive republic,"" that is, a large nation ranging over thirteen states, for then ""it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other.... The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States.""

>Madison's argument can be seen as a sensible argument for having a government which can maintain peace and avoid continuous disorder. But is it the aim of government simply to maintain order, as a referee, between two equally matched fighters? Or is it that government has some special interest in maintaining a certain kind of order, a certain distribution of power and wealth, a distribution in which government officials are not neutral referees but participants? In that case, the disorder they might worry about is the disorder of popular rebellion against those monopolizing the society's wealth. This interpretation makes sense when one looks at the economic interests, the social backgrounds, of the makers of the Constitution.

>As part of his argument for a large republic to keep the peace, James Madison tells quite clearly, in Federalist #10, whose peace he wants to keep: ""A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a particular member of it.""

>When economic interest is seen behind the political clauses of the Constitution, then the document becomes not simply the work of wise men trying to establish a decent and orderly society, but the work of certain groups trying to maintain their privileges, while giving just enough rights and liberties to enough of the people to ensure popular support.

Seems to me we should focus on the majority ""discovering their own strength, acting in unison with each other.""  Not saying ""our purposefully anti-democratic Republican system is democratic enough."""	"2021-12-11 11:39:46"

Interesting that patriotism to you sounds like a Workers Union Movement where freedom to chose your own destiny is only ok until you don’t like it. 
What is interesting is people disagree with a CEO’s ideas but have no skin in the game. Chances are the CEO has stock and options at risk. If the company fails, he looses all his invested money but you just loose a job which you can go get another a lot easier that  the CEO let alone recovering his investment.

And they know “supply chain issues” are temporary so unlike employers in the service sector who are raising wages because they need to open the doors every day, a company like Kellogg’s will wait them out or hire scabs bc “giving in” to the union will simply empower other workers to demand reasonable hours and a living wage - so for Kellogg’s it isn’t just about this plant or even all Kellogg’s plants - it will result in *all* workers asking for reasonable hours and living wages - which it why it is so so important not to let this slide under the radar.  

An employer announcing that it is going to replace it’s striking workforce should not be tolerated and it’s shameful that this is happening.

What I am saying though is that this is because the people one can vote for in the Democratic party are all neoliberals. One just needs to get small-time donations around leftist candidates and the second their name is out there, they will crush their neoliberal counterpart in many regions since the majority of the party will likely go for them. This will at bare minimum create a large caucus within the senate/representatives, allowing for greater ""push"". 

I don't know the actual breakdown of the party mind you, but imagine it 60 left, 40 moderate. The party will rally around one candidate in generals because the alternative is a far-right wingnut. The reason that almost all candidates reflect the 40% is because they have money backing their candidates who break free from a crowd of unknown candidates in preliminaries. This then forces the 60 to carry the neoliberal candidate in the primaries for the same reason that the 40 would be forced to vote for a left candidate, that the neoliberal is still better than the rightwing wingnut. 

Even if the party split 50/50 to form a new party, it would just result in 100% republican winning as neither new party would be able to contend with Republicans and both lose. So instead, just put out the left candidate and get attention in the preliminaries so they win. Then the 40 would have to back the left candidate instead of vice versa. Is it that simple? No. But splitting a party to form a third party would only work if you could attract enough from both sides to create 3 roughly equal parties. My bet would be the vast majority of the new party would come from the Democrats, lurching the country much harder to the right.

I get that both parties suck, I do. But I also get that lurching to the right is why we now have a 6-3 Supreme Court who is going to spend the next 40-60 years undoing much of the civil rights as well as basically prostrating themselves to big business."	"2021-12-11 11:33:56"

b) You calculated $2000 net, so living expenses are $1720/month. It would take 18-36 months to save the recommended 3-6 month of living expenses. Hell, it would take 6 months to save a single month of living expenses, and in the process you have exactly zero money to spend on anything else. Your life is literally about keeping yourself alive so you can go to work.

c) You forgot clothes and durable goods in your original budget. But I guess we can sleep naked on the floor. And hopefully we live close enough to work that we only have to fill up our car once a month.

d) You’re still missing the whole point of this. If you’re constantly living on the edge, it only takes a little nudge to send you off. “I did it” isn’t proof that it’s a workable approach—it’s survivorship bias. It’s okay to demand more."	"2021-12-11 11:31:36"

Forget operating a machine, we had classes to show everyone how to stop the equipment in an emergency. 

There is no way a new worker — even someone experienced— could use any of this equipment without weeks of training. It took me three months to learn the proprietary software and THAT was a record. Most people struggled to use the networked computers because it was so damned complicated. 

I can’t imagine how fucked we would have been if one machine operator was replaced with someone new, much less three or four who don’t know procedures, where supplies are located, how orders are processed, safety, etc. 

The electrical systems in most factories will kill you. It’s not just about making product. It’s about not getting killed by giant death trap machines.

Teachers in NSW are generally paid quite well compared to most other countries, but are overburdened with administrative work, which prevents effective teaching. This problem has been ignored by the NSW government for decades. Internal government documents were leaked and revealed that there may be a crippling teacher shortage in 5 years due to terrible working conditions.

They went on strike for a whole day on Tuesday.

2) Rail, Tram and Bus Union.

These guys argue against the NSW Government often about working conditions, train staffing and wage increases. They held  a few strikes this year.

 Go to a REAL lawyer. tell them what happened. Document every time that you get called a name, anytime you hear your coworkers getting disparaged. being called a r\*\*\*\*\* by your boss falls under the grounds of hostile work environment, which falls under harrassment. 

Go call a lawyer for a legitimate consultation. You'll want one that specializes in labor laws in your area. Ignore everything the legal advice subs have told you and put your trust in YOUR lawyer, because your lawyer will be the only person who will have a VESTED FINANCIAL INTEREST in your case. When you talk to them, do not hold back, tell them absolutely every time your boss or a supervisor may have said something disparaging about you to you, talk about it having negative effects on your life outside of work. Best case scenario, you win a harrassment suit. The worst case scenario is that the lawyer says that theres not enough for a solid case and you dont go to court.

>Kmart was Lampert's first majority stake, and he proved to be a better speculator than a manager. A 2013 Bloomberg article excoriates his Ayn Rand-inspired approach: In 2008, he split the company into 30 divisions—which swelled to 40 a year later—each of which reported profits separately and had to compete with the others for resources. Lampert was both strict with money and distant, seldom leaving his home in South Florida.29  
Divisions found themselves acting like separate companies, even drawing up contracts with each other. Compensation costs rose as each division hired its own senior management. These executives, in turn, had to form their own boards, and their pay was determined according to an in-house profit metric that led to cannibalization as some divisions cut jobs, forcing others to step in. The appliances unit found itself being gouged by the Kenmore unit, so it bought wares from LG, a South Korean conglomerate, instead.

>Kmart was Lampert's first majority stake, and he proved to be a better speculator than a manager. A 2013 Bloomberg article excoriates his Ayn Rand-inspired approach: In 2008, he split the company into 30 divisions—which swelled to 40 a year later—each of which reported profits separately and had to compete with the others for resources. Lampert was both strict with money and distant, seldom leaving his home in South Florida.29  
Divisions found themselves acting like separate companies, even drawing up contracts with each other. Compensation costs rose as each division hired its own senior management. These executives, in turn, had to form their own boards, and their pay was determined according to an in-house profit metric that led to cannibalization as some divisions cut jobs, forcing others to step in.

To try to make it work you have to keep watering it down, and all you get to is a european style benefits system. They're better than nothing, and I can see why they might seem appealing if you don't have them, but it isn't a radical idea and is a perpetuation of the system of exploitation. It's taxpayer subsidy for capitalist unemployment. I'm not interested in minute reforms, I only have one life, it's all or nothing I'm afraid.  

Socialism and communism are systems or ideologies that would motivate me to work, and work hard. Possibly that's not the case for everybody, but certainly it'd make me work where UBI can't and capitalism only can by coercion.

you still haven't persuaded me that UBI isn't utopian or badly thought out sillyness, even if I agree with your motive to improve people's lives, I just can't see why people fixate on UBI as some kind of wave a magic wand solution.

The word has a double meaning and both are negative and meant as a demeaning term.


The method of striking used back in the 1800s was call a ""screw"", because they'd take turns in which workplace to strike at on any given day, both to keep most of the paid work, but also to keep the employers from being able to hire new staff on a daily basis. A series of many small strikes at random times could hit a broader part of the supply chain while still maintaining the right to get paid for 80% of the days where they did work. They would be working mostly, but as a whole, the supply chain still didn't function. This kind of cross sector organization is very impressive.
The unorganized people breaking the strike were figuratively breaking ""the screw"".


The second meaning is that the people who did break the strike by still working were so unskilled that they literally couldn't put a screw in without breaking it."	"2021-12-11 11:22:17"

08.00: ""Err not sure yet. Will call as soon as we know"" Fine. Paid day rate so if they want me to sit at home great.

10.30: ""Yeah store C. Get there as soon as you can""

12.00 turn up at C to be screamed at by idiot manager for not being there for opening.

I try to explain but he won't listen. Having complete meltdown because had no staff at all. The girl who had been there that morning  had walked before I got there.

Told him.in clear terms to back TF off or I would walk as well. Oh no. He had lost it.

So I walked, called office who said it was OK, hang around in area as Regional Manager and Relief Manager on way.

Now of course what is drowned out is the benefits. Who cares if you pay union dues if your wage doubles or more. Unions decor seniority but many companies don't promote at all and union seniority is at least a known factor.

But neither communism or socialism has any moral solutions to the problem of incentives to do the job. If given a choice and no incentive, no one wants to play around in garbage or clean people's asses. So the only solution in purely those situations is that you force people to do those things.

So, I think the final point is that eventually productivity doesn't become the goal or the requirement. That would be when technology replaces workers. But you'd need to position social safety nets so people are accustomed to not need to work and you just elimate the human presence from the core system.

Give everyone a tax free threshold; in other words, every dollar you make below say $10,000 per year isn't taxed. EVERYTHING above that is taxed at 18% up to a threshold of $100,000. Anything above that is taxed at 40%. You can claim deductions on this amount, but you can only reduce your tax bill down to 20% of all taxes above the $100,000 threshold. NO exceptions. If you did this, then people would be paying their fair share of tax. It means that people would still donate to charities to reduce their tax bill, and still be buying assets for their businesses.

Australia does have a bracket system of income taxes:

0- $18,200: No tax  
$18,201- $37,000: 19%  
$37,001- $90,000: 32.5%  
$90,001- $180,000: 37%  
$180,000+: 45%

""Employees who are not represented by a union also have rights under the NLRA. Specifically, the National Labor Relations Board protects the rights of employees to engage in “concerted activity”,  which is when two or more employees take action for their mutual aid or protection regarding terms and conditions of employment. A single employee may also engage in protected concerted activity if he or she is acting on the authority of other employees, bringing group complaints to the employer’s attention, trying to induce group action, or seeking to prepare for group action.

A few examples of protected concerted activities are:

Two or more employees addressing their employer about improving their pay.

Two or more employees discussing work-related issues beyond pay, such as safety concerns, with each other.

An employee speaking to an employer on behalf of one or more co-workers about improving workplace conditions.

The law we enforce gives employees the right to act together to try to improve their pay and working conditions, with or without a union. If employees are fired, suspended, or otherwise penalized for taking part in protected group activity, the National Labor Relations Board will fight to restore what was unlawfully taken away."""

TL;DR: I got written up for getting locked in a freezer for almost 20 minutes.

A few years ago I worked at a certain fast food place that will remain unnamed. It was a day like any other. I went into the freezer to grab some stock and the door slammed shut behind me. No big deal, yeah? Not on your life. See, the handle to open the door from the inside was missing entirely. I tried looking around around to see if maybe it fell out or something, but no. It was just gone. I did the next best thing and pulled out my cell phone to attempt calling the front except. . . There was no signal in the freezer.  

Believe me when I say I tried my best to stay calm while calling out for ANYBODY and banging on that door for what seemed like forever. I was dressed for summer and the cold was seeping in *fast*

It took nearly 20 minutes for a coworker to finally come and open the door to find me in the midst of a panic attack (I have CPTSD) and bawling. When I told my manager about the broken door and made the comment that things could have ended differently if coworker hadn’t come along in time, I was written up for “*taking an unauthorized break.*” She then had the absolute gall to tell me I was lucky she didn’t fire me for breaking the door just to get out of work. 

Found out from the janitor immediately after that the door had been broken since 3rd shift (I was 1st shift) and the manager was made well aware of this. Not sure wtf my manager’s deal was, but I didn’t come in for another shift after."	"2021-12-11 10:59:06"

So really, every 2 hours they had 45 minutes where work wasn't being completed.  Combined with the mandatory hour lunch, the shop was only actively working for 4 nonconsecutive hours per 8 hour shift.

If an employee walks into a company store and steal 10€ worth of goods they can call the cops.

If an ceo of said company was invited into your house and then started taking stuff worth 10€ could you also call the cops.

Same goes for the other example, If the company did work on your property and you own them 100€ for the work they have to file a civil suit. Just like you have to file one if they they don’t pay for your work.

People just find it more intrusive when you take something someone is already in possession off compared to refusing to pay back a depth. 

Not sure what the alternative would be? Reintroduce prison for people who can’t pay their debts? Remove private ownership of things, or decriminalize stealing so you have to sue privately if someone takes your stuff?"	"2021-12-11 10:57:39"

"1373"	6	3	"### How do we make things better?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see a lot of conversation on this sub about how much the world needs change. This change could be a 4 day workweek, universal healthcare, a $15.00 minimum wage, or any number of other things, but 2 basic commonalities exist to all of these proposals:  
&nbsp;  
-They could only feasibly be enacted through an act of law  
-They cost the wealthy a lot of money  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two factors ensure that the rich will never grant you such things through the goodness of their hearts.
### So how do we do it?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first answer for many is to vote, and the most important realization for those present here is that this method will never work in isolation. If Democrat politicians really wanted to help you, they very easily could. Democrats have held a majority in congress, sometimes a super-majority, many times, and have even held the title of president. What's stopping Joe Biden from pulling out the executive order at every employer who looks at him funny?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Democrat and Republican politicians are hardly mirror images of one another, it is important to understand that they are both acting as part of the same mechanism. Like a ratchet and pawl, permitting movement only in a single direction, the two parties continuously make our lives worse for the benefit of the rich. Democrats spend their time pacifying those who are unwilling to accept things as they are, and Republicans are occupied with convincing the people to ignore reality itself as it deteriorates around them. In a system with only Democrats, it would become immediately obvious that government had no intention of doing anything, and one with only Republicans would revolt almost immediately in the absence of a world-class propaganda department. A system with both permits an eternal stagnation, in which no improvements materialize. How then could things possibly be improved, if not at the ballot box?  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know that, with over 3 million nationwide participants, the largest one day protest in the history of the United States was the 2017 Women's March? Most of you did not. This is the problem with protests - they are easily ignored. If the protestors conduct themselves peacefully, refuse to damage property, listen to the instructions of police, and maintain order, then they may as well have stayed home. The point of a protest is to inconvenience the powerful, and if you fail to do this you have accomplished nothing at all.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many will point to Martin Luther King Jr, Rosa Parks, or Mahatma Gandhi as successful peaceful protestors, but none of them acted in isolation, and they certainly didn't follow the instructions of the police. Each protested in an atmosphere already rife with impatience, where the threat of public violence silently loomed over the necks of the empowered. It is of course in the interests of the powerful, when they are forced to make concessions, to acknowledge the peaceful protestors as being the most effective, regardless of whether or not they actually were.  
&nbsp;  
### How do we convince them?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are of course forms of peaceful protest that aren't merely about getting together and waving signs around. One notable example is the consumer's boycott. I will say very little on their efficacy except that they cannot hurt. However, it requires both a large number of participants and a great deal of effort from all of them to be even remotely effective. One can see from other posts just how many brands one would need to keep track of just to cut Kellogg out of their life. In addition, this is not a good method at enacting economy-wide changes. Sure, if you don't want to buy food from big companies, you could maybe go to a farmer's market. But what about your car? Your computer? Your cell phone? You're not exactly going to be finding any small-town automotive plants, and a startup chip fab would be pure fantasy.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next method is the strike. Unlike a buyer, who has to buy every type of device and product they could ever need, a worker only has a few jobs (hopefully just the one), and can devote far more effort as an individual to crippling their workplace. They also have far more cohesion with their fellow workers, allowing for better coordination. However, a strike needs to have coordination to work. This is frequently what is undermined - by convincing employees that those who wish to strike are only doing so for personal gain, or simply to sow chaos, the workers can be turned against each other.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have theorized the possibility of a General Strike, in which a significant portion or even a majority of the entire population simultaneously abstains from work as a means to enact economy-wide change. Although we may be quick to dismiss it for the sheer number of necessary participants to create motivation, it is hardly an impossibility. Through the creation and collaboration of large trade unions, people in India conducted a general strike consisting of over 250 million people, if only for a single day. It is important to keep in mind the great number of points of failure in this method, but to dismiss it outright is foolish.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limiting factor on these forms of peaceful protest has thus far been in terms of number. Given that we live in a divided nation, you can count on only half of the population to support you even nominally, and many Democrats are not on your side once things start getting dirty. There are of course other means of protest. As a general rule, the greater the punishment assigned to an action, the more effective it is.  
&nbsp;  
### What do we do if they say no?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riot is perhaps the most controversial sort of non-peaceful protest. One cannot be mentioned without everyone in the vicinity announcing whether or not they approve of it. It is, however, undeniably effective. Riots themselves inflict little actual damage on the powerful, as their property is (obviously) going to be insured for such events, but when confronted with an image of a public so enraged that they are willing to flagrantly violate the law and face the violence of their heavily armed police, they become absolutely petrified. This is by far the one thing they fear most.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, leftists like to speak of *direct action*. For the uninitiated, direct action is when a coordinated group of individuals, usually a small one, takes some form of direct action (hence the name) to alleviate a problem. Direct action is not a form of protest - direct actors do not seek to convince those above them to solve the problem for them, they seek to solve it themselves. For example, instead of petitioning their government to enact climate regulations, direct action might consist of disabling oil pipelines, thereby directly halting production. Recently, this subreddit flooded Kellogg's scab recruitment page with fraudulent applications - this too is a form of direct action. Of course, not all direct action is illegal or even disruptive. Feeding the homeless could also be a form of direct action.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When more peaceful means fail to prosper, and the people have been robbed of their voices, the only voice the people have left is the bellow of gunfire. The most extreme form of direct action is, of course, direct violence, where the powerful are removed from power entirely by simultaneously being removed from life. I will not speak at length on the topic, for obvious reasons, but it is important to keep this in mind.

Generally, if new information, especially raw data that you previously weren't aware of, can't change your viewpoint then you need to acknowledge it's based entirely on opinion - what you *want* to believe; what's *convenient* to believe. If everyone here thought that way, the movement would fail spectacularly.


I only mentioned your temper because you got disproportionately angry when your view was challenged; scrolling through your comment history didn't exactly change my mind. You seem to be into some pretty brutal stuff; commenting on the strategies of gory drive-by shootings and advocating for prison rape aren't exactly the hallmarks of a healthy mind. I have genuine sympathy for the woman that you hit, and I hope that you're getting the help you need to manage your rage. I'm sure the system that we live under is at least partially to blame for your anger; doing time over something as simple as a drug charge would probably make me angry too - maybe that contempt for the system is why you're here.. but you're not of any use to the movement if you're going to bury your head in the sand and ignore what's actually happening around you.

Many ideals can dovetail that's why they're ideals.
No, wearing a mask all the time is not a healthy thing even the boxes themself say that improper use can cause death. No, doctors during routine visits have not always worn masks and you're not going to pretend that now.
If your vaccines actually worked, then the masks can be completely eliminated. I am exempt from having to participate in all of the things that you list.

We saw the same shit happen with John Deere where they were replacing their workers with administrative guys and you had crashes with forklifts and 10 guys having to go to the hospital and shit.

Kellog threatening to fire everyone and replace them with non union workers is an empty threat that just isn't a possibility these days. It used to be possible because of rascist unions then you could go to the black community and resume all production. Then you had local people with a mix of skilled and unskilled workers.

These days we don't have a permanent underclass we are that class and we have no segregation in the unions. So Kellog can't pull workers from the local community because these are either company towns where or they would have to convince your neighbors to take your job for less pay.

Apparently they made ads to look for replacement workers but I would guess they outsourced the hiring of replacement workers and because these managers have always acted like the workers are unskilled and replacable they restart production on a line factory. That is insane and imo should be forbidden. In a line factory there is no halve speed production, you can't stop production partially. It's a continuous flow from the creation of the product until it's all packed and shipped. If a guy that puts stuff in boxes has to wait on a forklift to bring him more boxes you have a production stop for the whole line and if no one takes away the full boxes you have this stuff again. So created an environment that is dangerous for workers using machines they don't know to forklift drivers driving on full speed trying to catch up and they don't know the factory so have no idea which route to use where. This in a food production facility which brings an extra set of regulations.

edit: this is an article on the 2014 incident. It's a super biased article that blames the workers in my opinion. They say it happened during a labour dispute and Kellog is going to investigate it. A factory knows who was there when they just can't admit that it was Kellog's fault for using scabs and The Guardian is helping them by talking about a labour dispute instead of strike.

"1897"	1	0	"I was a high end stripper, sugar babe, and e girl (all no contact, fully legal) for years. I'm also acquainted with insanely high-end escorts. I understand firsthand the privilege that comes along with that life, so I understand your wife's point of view. Probably even more-so, because I didn't have to screen anyone, I only worked when I had the staffing of executive security, and I had the safety of law enforcement behind me because I never broke the law.

I'm glad your wife makes a great living, but decriminalizing isn't about making Johns' lives easier/better or green lighting more people into the sex trade. It's also not about prioritizing the safety of the most privileged high-end escorts. It's about giving all FSSWs the same protections under the law that anyone else gets, which in turn makes the world safer for not just SWs, but also women as a whole. 

As is, high end escorts are generally not the focus of law enforcement. Both consensual and non-consensual FSSWs are still targets of violence because predators know that they may avoid going to police due to fear of prosecution themselves. There are literally trafficked children behind bars in the USA for defending themselves against men that trafficked/raped them. Look up Cyntoia Brown or Chrystul Kizer.

Prostitution is still more dangerous than any other profession. You say that your opinion is only in regards to high end escorting, but the laws aren't only applied to high end escorts (actually, rarely applied to high end escorts)- they apply to all FSSW, including the many that are less privileged, which you yourself acknowledge exist. 

""My wife and I are pretty sure we can go our whole lives without getting caught, since (at least in the world of high end escorting) only the stupidest girls get caught.""

The arrogance in this is astounding. We should still care about FSSWs that don't have the technical savvy or the pretty privilege to be deemed high end escorts. Note that trafficked women and children still catch charges.

""Screenings and background checks are extremely easy to do.""

Not for trafficked people and streetwalkers, they aren't. When backpage and similar platforms went down in the FOSTA-SESTA times, a lot of previously privileged escorts that were able to book their clients online and screen their clients before meeting face-to-face lost their safer client streams and had to freestyle to maintain their income.

Admittedly, I haven't kept up since the pandemic- so I don't know which avenues FSSWs are using these days and there may be something new since then.

""The argument I don't accept is when people make it out as if keeping it illegal is basically sentencing these women to violence. Screening and background checks are so easy and when high end escorts cite violence within the profession, they are coopting struggles of street walkers that they do not actually suffer from. The average high end escort lives much more like the wealthy men she services than she lives like a street walker and it is much more fitting to think of her and her job as being as oppressed as an attorney who owns his own law firm than to think of her as being subject to streetwalker problems.""

You're taking your extremely limited secondhand knowledge in regards to the most privileged bracket of FSSW and arguing against something that would benefit the majority. And honestly, as a man who will never face sexual violence for his job, you are completely clueless to the threat of sexual violence towards SW"	"2021-12-11 14:23:14"

The blame lies on all of us for electing scumbag politicians who lie to us and then get into office.  And this isn't just one party, its both of them.  When you have a Congerss that is reelected over 90% of the time thats a problem.  Serving in Congress was never meant to be a career.  Everyone focuses on the person in the White House.  What that person does in four or eight years has far less impact to the health of our nation than the morons we have in Congress.  Why do you think they fight so hard to maintain control?  Its all about power and money.  Look at the laws they have passed and how they have impacted society and how rich they have become off of being a public servant.  

Take for example the 2008 housing and financial crisis.  That can be traced back to Jimmy Carter for the Housing Crisis and Bill Clinton for the Banking Financial crisis.  But both parties were complicit in Congress because in both timeframes the Congress was controlled by each party.  Remember power and money!

When you get angry at Boomers try to remember not all of them are rich.  And the ones that did manage to make it and save most of them earned it.  Also remember their parents grew up in the Great Depression and had nothing.  And if your parents are telling you don't expect anything from them maybe you should ask yourself why.  I read one comment where a Mother said she wasn't giving her kid anything.  I have no advice for you there.  There is obviously more to the story.  

When you keep giving people entitlements they will keep taking them and expecting them.  Congress could have solved the social security impending crisis decades ago but continues to kick the can down the road along with other important other things."	"2021-12-11 14:19:18"

The US CEO pay situation is the result mostly of factors that occurred in the past 40 years in our government, not factors inherent to capitalism: a system that for the past few decades legally privileges corporate indebtedness & growth over return on capital via dividends, extreme market consolidation in most industries due to the decline of antitrust regulation, the killing of unions due to the decline of labor law, and significant tax advantages granted to ""performance-based"" stock options in the 1980's.  Combined, these triggered a runaway arms race by corporate boards, which basically wouldn't have happened without changes imposed under the Reagan Administration.

Other countries didn't go through this escalation, and so you get situations where a $7B Japanese company buys a $500M American subsidiary only to find out that the guy running the American subsidiary makes $12M/year, and the guy running the Japanese company makes $1.1M/year.  The situation is frankly embarrassing internationally, because in countries that continued to develop as liberal democracies & never saw a Reagan parallel, this level of wealth inequality is considered socially excessive, just as we would consider Putin or the Saudi family's oil & gas wealth socially excessive."

His parents paid his rent ($1500) every single month, were paying for his college tuition, sent him money for food and clothes and fun, and gave him $20,000 to start a ‘skate clothes brand’, which he advertised by vandalizing the local skate park. He’s the only rich person I’ve ever been friends with and he was so incredibly out of touch that it made me sort of understand how things got this bad.

He did make films after but they mostly (with the exception of State of the Union) paled in comparison to what came before them (personally I have more love for the educational films he directed following It's a Wonderful Life).  It was eventually a success in release but was such an extremely modest one that it was a box office disappointment for all involved. 

 Liberty Films, the independent production company Capra founded with Samuel J. Briskin had limited financial resources and thought It's a Wonderful Life was a sure thing but wasn't as big of a hit as they had hoped.  In his autobiography, Capra mentions that Liberty Films couldn't count on any profits from the film for a year.  The film premiered on December 20th 1946 and was in general release in January of 1947 and had only earned 2 million by the time Liberty Films was sold to Paramount (Time Magazine, May 26, 1947).  I've read differing amounts as to the cost of the film, ranging from 2.3 million (the Time Magazine article) to 3.18 million (IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes) and that it eventually earned 3.3 million during its release (IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes again).  Technically not a bomb but so much of a financial disappointment that they couldn't keep things going after having spent so much on this film (much more than the average big budget film.  The costs of producing films were increasing, the box office was in a period of decline for the rest of the decade, and at the end of the first release at the worst estimate the film made less of a profit than the average amount Monogram spent on one of their films.  It was a company built by artists not businessmen so they sold the company to Paramount for stock and some film deals.  We got Shane, State of the Union, Roman Holiday, and others out of it so it could have been worse.

I just think audiences in the postwar period outgrew his films.  The films that followed were (State of the Union being an exception), for the most part, tired retreads of films from earlier in his career. He couldn't (or wouldn't) adapt to the changes in Hollywood (read his autobiography and how Claudette Colbert wasn't cast in State of the Union), his films just weren't speaking to his audience any longer, and I don't think he could reconcile himself to this new reality.  His complaints in the last chapter of The Name Above the Title always struck me as rather bitter, especially when compared to the rest of the book."	"2021-12-11 14:17:21"

My husband is a (salary) engineer at a factory. The hourly folks are unionized. Several years ago it was contract negotiating time and it went poorly and the union went on strike. The company hired scabs. Now I don't know how typical this is, but per my husband (who had to continue to report to work like ""normal"", more on that below) the scabs were a group of guys who make traveling around together scabbing/temping in American factories their full time thing. He said they seemed nice enough and had experience with factory work *in general*, but factory work often requires very specific skill learned on the job to do well. It's hard work and you have to have a lot of practice to do it well (at least here). So the scabs were really expensive *and* really bad at the work. My poor husband got ordered by his boss to work as a shift supervisor so they'd stop ruining stuff (the guys on the picket line, who hubs gets on well with, thought this was a hoot). Eventually the company folded, the union guys came back, CEO got fired for wasting millions of dollars being stubborn, and my husband got to go back to his 9-5 in his office. Also took them years and $$$ to replace all the (non-union) welders who quit during the strike. We're hoping the company learned its lesson. Hopefully soon Kellogs will too.

At first, in the summer, I was doing more hours, but then school started, so I asked for less hours (other people in the group wanted more hours, so it should have been an easy decision), but the union had a rule, people that had worked there the longest had to get more hours. Since I started working there the morning the store first opened, I was the one in my group who was supposed to get the most hours. My boss had no choice but to fire me not to get in trouble with the union... I called the union, they didn't want to make an exception to their rule, so they refused to help me."

Take it up with Palahnuik then, since this is literally and textually how the novel and film represent it. The Narrator _is_ mentally ill, it is a fact of the plot, and arguably the central narrative element that makes the ‘twist’ possible. There are of course other themes in the story, but the Narrator’s mental illness is a core element that anchors the rest of the plot. 

>	just be a little bit more descriptive of the reasons people believe these things and why it’s wrong

People believe these things for the same reason that characters in the movie believe them. The problem is simply that people forget that the movie explicitly _rejects_ these ideas after introducing them. Tyler Durden is the villain, not the hero of the piece."	"2021-12-11 14:06:56"

"2209"	1	0	"I remember a while after the merger I started having that ""Blizzard just hasn't been the same"" train of thought. It's been really strange finding out that they were always *very* similar, even before then.

Honestly I'd been pretty disappointed with Blizzard as a creative entity probably since at least StarCraft 2. StarCraft was one of my favorite games for a long time and it felt like the writing quality coming out of the company changed pretty noticeably since at least WoW's Wrath of the Lich King expansion.

Anyway, my point being that I often wonder how much my disillusionment with Blizzard made it easier to deal with finding out they're actually a really shitty workplace. So far every notably employee that has been exposed as a creep has elicited an immediate ""fuck them"" instead of a ""not them too?!""

I think you can see this difference in attitude from people when you look at Riot. Riot is still a shit work environment with employees accused of misconduct (such as Greg Street, formerly of the Blizzard Cosby Suit) and even *currently under investigation*, but since it keeps making products that a lot of people still love no one talks about them the same way everyone talks about Blizzard, even though they're so incredibly similar."

So FNV healthcare, FNV government, ABP (basically FNV police). And the same goes for CNV. And usually it is those unions who make a deal with the sectorial organisation (collective bargaining). Not everyone works under those rules, but nearly everyone does (>80%). Not as much as in the Nordic countries, which rely heavily on collective bargaining and have no minimum wage. But more than most other European countries and with a fairly high minimum wage.

All non union members benefit from the protection and collective bargaining if there is a union active in their sector. Union members get some additional support (e.g. legal support). Sadly, membership is dropping, I think people have gotten used of the protection given by unions while not being members, thus not seeing a reason to be a member. That is fine for now, but if it will continue, the unions will get significantly weaker. It is a trend that has to be turned around IMO."	"2021-12-11 14:02:59"

Why do you think corporate media is obsessed with running culture war stories and inflammatory rhetoric? They’re running cover for the corporate establishment.

It also explains why they’re relentlessly shitting over the few non-corrupted progressives in congress, the only people actually fighting for the policies the corporate politicians claim to want to see passed. The reason: their corporate donors dont want it passed, and neither do the corporate puppet politicians, they do it every fucking time. Use progressive talking points to win elections, immediately abandon and get nothing done but platitudes, become unpopular, blame a rotating villain (Manchin/Sinema this time, Liebermann during Obama’s term) and if we had + 20 Dems in the senate. 21 would arise and say “its not fiscally responsible to do healthcare, or public housing, or voting rights, or economic reform and stronger workers rights” because they dont actually WANT it to happen… and the media runs cover for them and manufactures consent against anyone calling out their corruption or even hinting at it..

I've yet to be able to determine if the area was under tornado warning at the time. That's the only reason people would have known to take shelter. The only real strong point in this style of construction are places with substantial plumbing, but the employees would have been told where to shelter so they'd at least be able to recover the bodies.

I've also not seen anything that confirms a tornado hit the building. Dunno how much you know about US weather. The thunderstorms in the plains states can produce sustained winds of 70+mph and gusts as high as 110mph. It's most likely the building was engineered with insufficient safety factor, or had defects in construction.

If that seems cold and clinical what I'm saying is that this was more than likely a preventable tragedy that needs intense scrutiny. Unless the building was hit by a tornado that didn't trigger the alert system there was zero reason for anyone to die."	"2021-12-11 13:59:33"

F- Amazon and their need to force employees into work during severe weather. Anyone living in this region knows better than to be out --especially at night-- just because of how bad things can get so quickly. Of course though, they were probably told they'd get their attendance docked or some BS even in severe weather.

We need more patriotic socialists that want to keep the capitalists in check but are aware enough to know America has its problems but it really is a nice place to live and that there are those with similar ideals who would co-opt the group to subvert the nation and burn it down. You already see it on tv. Anarchists and rioters waving hammer and sickle flags that have no idea of the horrors of the holodomor. They smash the windows of small businesses and think they’re they’re confronting the bourgeoisie. Too many “socialists” have really become useful idiots of the state that will hop to whatever whiff of socialist promises they get and riot on command."	"2021-12-11 15:36:51"

It's almost realistically impossible to just say he's ""not as bad as Trump"" simply due to how fucking bad Trump was. And on the other hand he's historically had a pretty successful administration compared to people like Obama, who was considered a very good president.

Because what? He didn't arbitrarily use executive power to cancel student debt? Something he never said he was going to do, through a means of something we admonished Trump for just over a year ago?

I mean he literally ran on a campaign promise of ""Nothing big is going to happen, just no more crazy"", yet a bunch of people are expecting him to change the rotation of the planet.

Housing is viewed by our society as an investment vehicle. A means to gain. You're right. This is the primary reason why housing is now unaffordable.

Housing is a human necessity for survival, before anything else. 

Prior to the 1980s, residential real estate investing was not a common, everyday idea. Housing was just another commodity. The historical pricing of houses reflects this. When the residential home investing market was birthed in the mid to late 1980s, housing prices skyrocketed.

Here you are, proclaiming that housing is an investment, which means that you as in individual expect housing prices to rise. Because that's what society wants an investment to do, appreciate. But at the same time, society does not want, for example, gas prices or food prices to continue to rise, because society views gasoline and food as necessary commodities, not as a means of investing and gaining.

 It's funny. Cause. I never thought to question that before today. Thought that was just how I was. ADHD has had many effects. That I didn't even realize until after I became an adult.

That's where our opinions differ. I would suggest that  many Democrats hide behind procedure when it suits them, but are much more strident in their actions when it benefits their donors. As an example, I'm sure you're already aware but the standard procedure for authorising the use of military force in other countries is that it goes through Congress. The US President has powers to authorise in an emergency but those are not meant to be the standard way things are done.

There’s two last factors that the public never thinks about. Kellogg no longer has to pay salary, fund pensions and 401k, or pay for healthcare. They are saving a ton of cash. 

But they also paid to transport the scabs into the area, paid for housing, meals, transportation from the hotels and back again, laundry, and training only to get trained monkeys that 5 scabs can do the work of any 1 union worker. It’s not just speed - it’s also experience and rolling with the punches. 

Then there’s the anti Union specialists and anti Union lawyers. 

If only they chose to give all that cash to the workers rather than pay to fight them for a few months. It kills me how much money is wasted on this anti shit rather than spend it on the worker avoiding all that animosity. 

And best of all, management is dragged to the assembly line - many of whom has been working in a windowless office desk job. None of them can handle the physical labor and scheduling. It’s time to see if they can put their money where their mouth is and do the work. 

And everyday - all these scabs have to trickle thru the picket line of angry workers and their families. I grew up in a dysfunctional family. I don’t care how strong you think you are, dealing with that every day is draining."	"2021-12-11 15:19:49"

My work makes this complicated as we have full time company staff, casual labour hire staff and contract staff in training and management positions.

When the full time company staff go on strike the casual labour hire can't join in as they are on a different agreement and legally work for another company.  Same with the contract trainer's as we don't share an agreement they can't join us in strike.

That said attempting to use the barely trained labour hire staff and the trainers is a dead end as we have proven a few times.

They can't maintain any meaningful level of production and because they don't do it daily they are really bad at it.

To be fair I think we have 4 labour hire and 6 trainers along with about 70ish full time staff.

But if one of the full time staff cross that line they will be forever known as a scab industry wide.  Heavily unionised industry too.  The few guys who did it during a strike in the 80s are either retired or still shunned.

Amazon has like 1.3 million employees, so individually that's a pretty nice $150something each... until you realize that number doesn't count seasonal workers or people who work indirectly through contractors (most of the delivery drivers). I am guessing if you add them into the mix it would boil down to a few dollars each a day and sounds a lot less impressive.

My point? Breaking it down to what would be per day per employee is meaningless and ignores the fact that wealth compounds and creates more wealth very rapidly if you have a large base amount. I am shitty with math, yet I am able to understand that this level of equality is very unsustainable and creates an unstoppable transfer of money to the rich from the poor.

We need caps on how much executives earn to slow this down and make things more equitable.

Someone pointed out in a comment recently if a minimum wage person saved every penny they earned for the whole year, the interest would still be less than $2k annually at a 10% rate of return.

Of course for most people that's not possible as long as we don't have something like UBI, as they obviously have to provide for themselves.

But secondly, even if they could, why would they do it for free when there's people that would pay for it? Or why would you work for free for an employer when you can do so for yourself and at least own the work yourself?

When you have many equivalent options of doing the work you like, even if money wasn't the main motivation for doing the work, obviously you would be stupid to not take the one that is simply most profitable for you, would you not?

Bandaging the parts has been practiced with success. Tying the hands is also successful in some cases; but this will not always succeed, for they will often contrive to continue the habit in other ways, as by working the limbs, or lying upon the abdomen. Covering the organs with a cage has been practiced with entire success. **A remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of phimosis.** The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment, as it may well be in some cases. The soreness which continues for several weeks interrupts the practice, and if it had not previously become too firmly fixed, it may be forgotten and not resumed. If any attempt is made to watch the child, he should be so carefully surrounded by vigilance that he cannot possibly transgress without detection. If he is only partially watched, he soon learns to elude observation, and thus the effect is only to make him cunning in his vice.  ""

I have seen some comments on this sub from people I believe are working on behalf of corporate interests, I believe this to be the case because they are deliberately using what I call ""dividers"". Terms and narratives designed to split working class people apart to make us argue amongst ourselves rather than uniting for a common cause, usually disguised as leftist talking points but make no mistake, they are in service to corporate overlords. 

A favourite (and most effective) tactics used by these people is to invoke race. Race is a hot button issue and it's very easy to get reactionary comments which in turn spur reactions and it can spin out into a full blown argument, with the flames endlessly fanned by corporate shills working to break us apart. 

I have seen comments claiming that the kellogs strike is a chance for POC workers to free themselves from ""White slavemasters"" this is a common way that leftist language can be used to fuel a corporate agenda, using provocative language and planting a false mental image in people's heads of what's really going on. DON'T FALL FOR IT! the corporate media will push this too, they'll say that ""certain elements"" in the striking workers are ""white supremacists"" too without any shred of evidence because it provokes an immediate reaction of revulsion from the public and can easily cause leftist groups and movements to quickly collapse into infighting. 

People of ALL races are part of the kellogg's strike. ALL. A white man working 16 hours a day 7 days a week for barely 5 dollars an hour is getting fucked over just as much as a black woman working 16 hours a day, 7 days a week for barely 5 dollars an hour. 

Don't allow ourselves to be torn apart or start bickering when these tactics get used to distract us and make us turn against eachother. I've seen the left across the English speaking world devolve into a fucking joke since the end of the occupy movement by corporate interests using these exact same tactics. Only now is it truly starting to make a comeback and it's not through identity politics, it's through screwing over the top 1%, it's about organising unions and fighting for better conditions for the working class! 

Don't let yourselves be divided, whenever anyone uses these dividing tactics, they're wolves in sheep's clothing. Corporate shills wearing a thin mask of faux leftism. Beware of them because, they're here, and they're looking for ways to make us tear ourselves apart."	"2021-12-10 20:35:55"
"3378"	6	2	"This happened in 2019. 

This was my first job when I got out of 90 inpatient mental health facility. (TLDR: GF cheated on me and was emotionally abusive, had a mental breakdown and had to spend time away to get my shit together).   I was hired as a food runner at a nice restaurant in FL, I kept messing up the table numbers and would say ""Thanks Chef"" every time he handed me a plate of food to run. 

Now, for context, every restaurant job I've worked at since I was 21 I would ask the GM/ Shift Manager if they would like to come out for a drink after shift (all of the joints i worked at, the whole FOH would grab a drink on a friday night, just to be polite and get to know my bosses a little more). 

Well, a few weeks of doing food running, I kept fucking up the table numbers/certain dishes at the tables. One day, I get to work and GM pulls me to the side and says im going to be bussing tables from now on. Not a big deal, same tips and pay, plus i get to actually talk to people at the tables while im bussing it down. 

About 3 months into bussing everyone is loving me, servers, managers, bartenders, and even a bunch of customers. Well, one night after shift we all go out for someone's birthday. As im leaving for the night, i ask the GM if they would like to join us. He says ""Ok yeah sure but only so you stop bugging me about it"" 

We get to the bar and a bunch of us are just bitching about the long shifts. GM gets there and shakes my hand and says ""You've been doing great recently"" I say thank you and offer to buy him a beer. About 30 min goes by and I mention to him how i would like to be a server after season ends (Around May, 3 months out). He laughs in my face and says ""The chef would NEVER make you as a server. (Chef's cousin owned the place, he basically ran it with the GM)

I asked him point blank. ""Why not?"" He proceeds to tell me how Chef hates me for being so polite and because i fucked up as a food runner and that he wanted the GM to fire me after i fucked up. I kind of laugh it off at first but it was kind of embarrassing that he said that in front of all my co workers. 

Once covid closed the place for a few months i found out that they may have stole my tips from me in season.

After 8 years of solid attendance and routinely good quarterly reviews, I was suddenly being treated like disposable garbage. All because I had to take 6 months off from work due to health issues.  

I'd gotten infected during the first Covid wave in Feb 2020 and subsequently had a heart attack in March 2020 from blood clotting issues and spent 6 months recovering from the mental and physical trauma. I have a severe family history of fatal heart attacks, 5 out of 13 aunts and uncles, including my father were all dead by 60 from heart disease and half of them had a first episode in their 30s. Needless to say, this scared the sh\*t out of me and I started having extreme anxiety attacks which left me hospitalised another 2 times with hypertension. The Anxiety got so bad I eventually had to break down and seek medication. However the side effects were almost as bad and I found myself having issues focusing, I couldn't remember basic things and would forget things I'd within minutes of having done them    

In spite of all this, after 6 months I started feeling ok enough to get back to work.  As soon I got back I felt a difference in behaviour from my colleagues. I had a new manager who was very combative and and narcissistic and within a few months I realised my job was under assault. Everything I did was was put under a microscope, colleagues whom I'd trained were criticising my work in extremely unflattering . It came as no surprise in June of this year when I was told I had put on an ""ïmprovement plan"". I fought tooth and nail and worked my ass off but nothing was ever good enough. When I started having meetings with the HR rep I brought up the fact that I'd had a severely traumatic experience and the side effects of my meds were affecting my work performance. I even pointed out that once I met a certain date off of them and the side effects would subside afterwards. This all fell on deaf ears and I was told what I'd written above.  Eventually I was told I needed to leave or my contract would terminated and I would ineligible for any unemployment benefits.

"3406"	0	60	"Hello. I come for meaningful dialogue. I identify as a centrist. I have views from both sides of the aisle and have a deep dislike for the lack of bipartisanship in today’s politics. To some on the right this makes me a “communist” and to some on the left this makes me an “authoritarian.” I’m used to it and don’t care that everyone hates me. But I contend that I do not violate rule 4.

As a background, I have a deep dislike for work. It sucks. I’d rather be on a beach. I’d rather be doing drugs and having fun with strippers. Maybe some people find significance in their work, such as a doctor who saves lives. I respect that, but I am not that person.

My view is that work is unfortunately necessary. We all need to eat and have shelter. Before civilized society, this meant going out to hunt, gather, and build shelter. That was work. We have now built a society where one can buy food without hunting or gathering it - through the use of money.

Money takes work to acquire. The government can print it to a point, but there must be an economy to tax to sustain the printing. So everyone not working doesn’t seem to be an option. You should choose to hunt or gather, but this is still work. You can sell your body, but this still takes work. The only exception to all this is if you’re gifted with money, such as through an inheritance. But the money still took work to acquire from the gifter’s perspective.

So I view work as a necessary evil. I don’t want to do it. I want to quit working as fast as possible. For me, that means taking a high salary now and investing as aggressively as possible. I hope to build up enough wealth where I don’t need to work.

This is my perspective. I am confused though by the perspective of people in this subreddit. It seems as though most people here still think there should be work. They are overjoyed about the unionization of Starbucks - presumably these employees still need to work. Do people here still want to work, but just cap it at 40 hours and pay higher wages?

It appears as though this subreddit is less about being anti-work and more about being a pro-union leftist. At least that’s what I have observed.

I don’t care about downvotes so feel free to give me one. But I do genuinely come in peace. I sympathize that work sucks. For me, that means sucking it up and getting to a place where I don’t need to work ASAP. I respect people who feel differently.

"3408"	0	10	"I understand the desire for no work. For anti establishment. For demolishing capitalism (or as I would point out more accurately, destroying *crony* capitalism).

I get that desire. We live in a corrupt evil society full of greedy no-gooders. The reality is though this isn’t an issue with a system of governance or of economics. It’s an issue with human nature. We will always have people who want to steal from others. If it’s capitalism, communism, socialism, feudalism, etc. the heart of humans needs to be worked on. 

I would argue that to work on that. Is to work on responsibility. Carry weight. The weight of a job you don’t enjoy. The weight of a relationship that’s difficult but not toxic. (There’s a key line there in relationships, but we often in our day run away from them instead of compromise and work towards grow.) 

In our culture we speak of our rights in ever facet and space we can. No one speaks of how responsibility to your neighbors, your friends, your family, your job, yourself is what we need to become better people and grow. An end to work gives us an end to nothing that struggles inside us all. Our inner turmoil. The same turmoil human kind has been battling for centuries. What is my purpose. What is my role. Why am I here. Does this have any meaning? 

We’ll I don’t like my job. I’ve never liked any job. I’ve always searched for an external thing a person a place a new this or that to fix my angst. To rid my disdain for the job. Recently I’ve done something differently. I’ve become to look at myself to change instead. My job is still difficult but what in life isn’t? I want to be strong. I want to go towards the difficult task and I want t overcome it. I am not a victim of this society or this culture or this corruption. I’m an exception of it. I am growing to be bigger than it. I will do my part and carry my weight for the people I can. And I’ll make sure my heart is open and full and ready to give during the whole time. 

I will fail. But I will get up and try again. I won’t allow the inner voice of negativity to rule my actions. And once I’ve built the future I want. I will be strong enough to overcome those new challenges. Because working a job for someone else. Is nothing compared to running a whole operation for yourself. By yourself.

"3410"	2	0	"TLDR: I would like some help figuring out what to do in my situation. I've asked my usual people and haven't come up with anything viable yet, and I'm hoping the folks here will have some creative solutions.

**The Background**

It's taken almost 2 years of my being out of customer service work completely, for me to semi-recover (customer service burnout x100). I was out of work during pandemic year 1 (start of April), and pandemic year 2 (this year) I have spent in a 3 consecutive term, college trades program. 

**I'm finally beginning to feel like a person again; happy more frequently, excited about new tasks, and so forth.**

In this program, I got to learn and grow, enjoy things, try different trades, and meet humans from a safe-ish distance. I also got to use my free time however I wanted: develop skills in art and have fun; do research, hobbies and whatever I wished (within societal and personal financial constraints). 

However, this program is ending next week and my new, small and very fragile joy is at huge risk of slipping away. I mean, I'm trying not to think about it....but I know I will need to at some point soon, so I figured sooner is better than later.

**The Issues**

Problem 1: Mental & emotional health.

This program helped me realize how many cool skills I could develop--even trades I'd like to keep doing. However, the program also demonstrated vividly some issues in these trades, that I only overcame by reminding myself the program had a set end date, I'd paid for the class, and I could do it Just For Now. Whereas, if I were to take a job..... it wouldn't be the same. There is no end date to working, except death. 

I also realized that even though I enjoyed the trades in this program, I am once again upon its completion, glad to be done with the exhaustion of dealing with the bullshit that comes with other people and interacting with them (administration and professors; not fellow students). 

I don't want to be a hermit again (2020) but I also refuse to break myself anymore, for work. 

I do not want to and cannot, deal with the enormous mental and emotional effort, that comes with forced interactions with people and having to navigate them.

I can very easily see the experiences I had with such issues during this program, for example, turning into burnout again if they occured in a workplace. And that is one of many personal reasons I cannot do conventional work. Not that I do not want to; not that I don't wish I could. I simply cannot, without it adversely affecting me. But hating myself for having had trauma, or for my brain's abilities, is unuseful and unkind, so instead I'm upset at the systems which require forced labor under threat of homelessness, starvation, and indigence, and general suffering. I'd happily contribute if it wasn't a Do This Or Else hostage situation. Alas, it is. 

And I cannot willingly subject myself to a life where I work and come home to sleep and eat and repeat, so I have somewhere to sleep and eat so I can keep working; that's not a life; that's hell, and I'd rather they (capitalism) shoot me dead with some dignity, rather than fuck with me and refuse me dreams or a quality of life worth living for the next forty years. I'm simply unable to manage such. 

This leads to 

Problem 2: I'm concerned about what it will mean when I run out of funds, while being incapable of retuning to conventional workplace. 

As I see it, I either

1) need to make dollars another way outside of conventional workplaces

2) need to hope the world ends soon via zombies or aliens.

3) need to revisit the idea of my own non-existence. Which is unfortunate, because I'm finally enjoying life and wanting it to continue. 

Like, even though now I can see myself finding meaning and joy in being low stress, feeling safe, enjoying hobbies, making art, being a friend, watching tv series, going for walks, and doing research..... I'd be required to give all that up-- everything that makes my life manageable and enjoyable-- to keep a roof over my head, and food in the fridge.

By working I would stay alive biologically, but be simultaneously, by those very actions that would keep me alive, barred from keeping a quality of life worth continuing (to me). 

It's a maddening, beyond miserable scenario, and I hope to find a way out. I've asked folks I know for advice and unfortunately got shit from people who seem to be cognitively unable to process or understand what it means to not be capable of working in a conventional setting. 

Any practical advice folks here can give me are greatly appreciated. (E.g. lower stress atypical job options, ways to earn income more quickly so I could save funds and maybe start some sort of shop of my own eventually, etc). Hell, even just general comisserations of ""I dunno what to say except shit that sucks; I getchu"" are equally appreciated. 

**Important end notes** (which I add due to the prevalence of unhelpful or unkind comments I've unfortunately gotten in past) 

*please DO NOT suggest* that I 

A) ""seek mental health assistance"": I already have/ do/ am 😛 I have a therapist and I've worked with therapists off and on for many, many years. 

B) ""just pick something for now so you can save money"": 1. If I had the energy to do this I wouldn't be here asking these questions and 2. I've worked many, many ""stepping stone"" jobs, for many years, in the process of seeking better quality/ paying/ suited to me, options.  I've spent a great portion of my life doing this to no positive avail/ to the detriment of my mental health, to exhaustion and sadness.... not to mention living in the city I do makes saving impossible for a person working any sort of ""stepping stone"" minimum wage/ entry level job

I have been part of this organization for 5+ years. Things took a turn, and little to my knowledge the management team I was part of threw us in a six figure deficit. I wasn't part of their fiasco, and was offered my original position back by head office, since I was filling in temporary. Mean while, they brought in new blood. This new blood, made everyone's life a living fucking hell. 

I had enough when people were being moved around without notice, their schedules changing without taking into account of their personal lives, seeing management ask my co-workers to find their own coverage if they wanted vacation time off, co-workers being harassed by management and then covering it up when a complaint was made and seeing some lose hours off their pay, twisting conversations to their own benefit...etc.

Between a small group of us, we started calling around at different unions within our region asking questions. One union wanted a minimum of 90 members, that was impossible ours was 1/3 of that. Until we reached out to one who took us in, as is.

Our voting turned out to be 90% in favour, now certified by labour relations and recognized as a union and currently in bargaining. It wasn't easy, and at some points we felt like throwing the towel because the process takes a long time.

My boss the restaurant owner heard me say, “where’s the produce order, when is it coming” because I needed it to do my jobs for the day. The next thing I know he is standing in the doorway to the dining room screaming and cursing at me. It made me really anxious and I immediately had a hit of adrenaline and was shaking. The irony is he was screaming and cursing at me about being too loud. I said, “I’m sorry, it’s loud back here” and I do have a deep voice that carries according to my wife. I also said, “are you going to be professional or are you going to curse at me?” He just continued. So I had enough and I said, “no one gets to scream at me like that” I said it pretty calmly and didn’t raise my voice. kitchens used to be a very abusive and intimidating place to work in back in the day, and I promised myself I would  never let anyone talk to me like that anymore after a job I had that was daily abuse. Last week a different coworker lunged at me during a disagreement and I was already pretty fed up. Mostly because I felt like I had to be the one to apologize to him, and I didn’t feel like it was clear he had done anything wrong. I definitely was the only one who said sorry.

Among the calls for a boycott, I have been thinking a lot about if this would actually be beneficial for the workers. Hear me out, and please tell me what you think. I already dont buy any of their brands, so the decision to boycott or not doesnt really affect me.

There are definitely pros of a boycott. A boycott should theoretically hurt them where it matters most- in their wallet. If a large enough group were able to truly boycott Kellogg's until they renegotiated with the union, it would be devastating to the company. This requires a large group of people willing to sustain the boycott, with clear messages as to why they are doing it. But if the boycott goes right, it could be a huge help to the union workers- money is the only thing these corporations understand.

But there are also some cons to a boycott that are less obvious. A boycott is more helpful for Kelloggs in the short term. Their workers are striking, so they cant meet the demands of their distributors. But this also means they have a lot of cash that they arent paying to employees to help them ride out some bad press. A short term boycott will give Kelloggs Corporate time to figure out how to ramp up production without the union, while also maintaining their relationship and obligations to distributors. Currently, Kellogs has a problem of not being able to meet demand. By boycotting the company, the power of the union is weakened in the short term, as there is less demand for Keloggs to fill. Kelloggs long term solution may be that they let a small boycott continue for a while, giving them breathing room to hire scabs or find other ways to meet demands, and hope that once the news settles down they can basically get back to normal.

I literally dont know the right option. Have the Kelloggs union leaders asked for a boycott? I trust their judgment on the matter. There are a few other big names I might trust, but so far I haven't seen any of them, just people on Reddit.

Let me know if I'm wrong, but if a boycott is the right answer, it needs to be big, have clear messaging, and be backed by people who are willing to only buy kelloggs again if and when they renegotiate with the union. Otherwise I feel like we are making it easier on the company."	"2021-12-10 19:48:29"

I know this is going to come off like “I’m Deep” material, but I honestly don’t get the point of life for the poor and the lower working classes under the US system today.

What’s the point of life?

Sisyphus had to labor to satisfy the sadistic cruelty of the gods, but you’re doomed to suffer so someone can buy their 5th rental property or 6th yacht. 

There is no point to your life other than the excess value that can be extracted from it. You’re like those factory farms that take the fresh born male baby chicks and toss them in a bucket to drown them, all with USDA govt. support to “stabilize” the market value of chicken. Your life only has “value” in the context of a market mechanism.

At least for the more prosperous white collar middle and upper classes, we have the promise of delayed gratification. That some amount of material reward will come and absolve us of any internal struggle about the contradictions between our internal values and the world we live in. 

The only reason we have any solidarity with the poor is because the “middle class” standard has been backsliding since the 70’s and Reaganomics took over. Otherwise, much of the middle class would probably be like the middle class of the 80’s and 90’s: deeply racist, lacking class solidarity, obsessed with “welfare queens” and demanding politicians to cut the social safety net. 

We in the middle classes only support the social safety net, Obamacare, free college, etc because we intend to benefit from those programs to hopefully live a future life of prosperity.

But for the lower and working classes, you don’t have a path to prosperity. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. People ages 35-60, working at or near minimum wage, maybe once middle class, but they’ve suffered some setback and been pushed down the rungs of economic stability. 

Walking to work in the winter, or taking two busses. No Health insurance. Maybe some crushing college or health debt. Spending 50% of their income on rent to live in some hovel in the worst part of town that requires a terrible commute with poor public transport.

What is the point of docility and going along with the system? To keep your $8 an hour job? To pay 50% of your rent to live in a boomers’ spare attic? How do you not write manifestos and go postal? 

You have nothing to lose but your chains. Honestly, the elites in our system will continue this system indefinitely until there is an uprising for political representation, labor unionization, and even possibly violent action. It’s not like the Indians, the Haitians, or the African American slaves got their freedom solely by marching peacefully. They only taught us about MLK because they don’t want us to know about Malcolm X and the black Panthers.

So I really don’t get why people seem so afraid of direct action even if they go to prison or die.

If you die the misery is over.

If you go to a (non-privatized) prison you literally get free housing, three meals, workout weights, a bed, and a free college education lol. 

They’re practically throwing people out of jails these days because they’ve locked so many people up on petty offenses like selling weed. Some states spend more on prisons than on their public education systems.

So how do you go on? How do you keep bringing children into this system of exploitation? How do you go to work everyday like lambs for slaughter? To have all your productive juices taken and monetized for market value? I don’t get it."	"2021-12-10 19:42:02"

"3454"	158	15	"Some time ago I was working as a server at a restaurant called Crawdaddys in Gatlinburg, TN. There was a meeting with all of the upper management of the concept as well as servers, restaurant managers, and HR. During this meeting a fellow server had a question about checks flying off the patio and how to fix this (it happened to her about two times before). The Director of Operations who was spearheading the meeting told the server to “Try your best to not let it happen.” and I immediately was pissed off at that response so I raised my hand and said “Can you give us a better answer than try your best, because that is an unacceptable answer.” I explained that we could find a solution together in less than 5 minutes. Needless to say I was on this lady’s radar for calling her out and probably embarrassing her in front of everyone. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I have this table, all but one pays with card. They walk out while I’m dealing with a different table and the one who didn’t pay with a card did not leave cash. I tell the manager what happened and she asked where I was when they walked out and I told her “Doing my job at another table.” After some time she comes up to me and says that they can discount the food but that I would have to pay the difference. I just looked at her and said “That’s not what the Fair Labor Standards Act says.” 

The look on her face was in astonishment and said she would get back with me. Several of the employees told me it’s happened to them before and they had to pay so I straight up showed them the FLSA and said that’s illegal and told them I’d walk out before paying anything. 

At the time the GM was on vacation and low and behold who does the MOD talk to for advice? That’s right the Director of Operations who became so fond of me. The manager pulls out the employee handbook and has sections highlighted that stated “misappropriation of funds is grounds for termination”. So when she was done with her speech trying to get me to pay I explained that if she could discount the food then she could comp it and she was choosing not to. Keep in mind this manager was new and so I purposely showed her the FLSA and explained it would be her name I put in the report.

I didn’t have to pay but she said I would have to talk with the GM when he was back. Of course this happened to a different server the next day and they paid for the walkout. When the GM was back I walked in and said good morning and he replied “Fuck this place.” I thought to myself that he was right so I set up the restaurant and just walked out. 

Long story short, don’t let anyone intimidate you and know your rights as a worker. Also don’t go to any Kennedy Concept restaurants in Gatlinburg or Knoxville."	"2021-12-10 19:40:57"

"3458"	46	17	"As it is the holiday season and many of you will spend time with your family, I thought I would share with you my friend, Paul's story. (just realized he is from the Silent Generation, not a Boomer).

Paul was a farm kid from Saskatchewan. Hated school and dropped out in Grade 9. Since he was not the oldest son, he knew he was not going to inherit the farm so he decided to move to Vancouver at 16. He got by there, since he was strong and could work hard, doing manual labour on construction sites.

At 21, he meets a girl and gets married. Now he realizes he needs a better job. One day he goes down to Vancouver City Hall and asks the receptionist for an application for the Police Department. The receptionist looks at him and says ""You aren't tall enough for the Police, plus they aren't hiring."" Dejected Paul turns to leave as the receptionist calls out "" The Fire Department is hiring and they don't have a height requirement. Why don't you apply there?"" So he fills in an application.

A couple months go by and  he gets a phone call. (Paul remembers this clearly). It was the Friday afternoon of a long weekend at 3 PM. The Fire Chief on the phone says to Paul ""If you still want to be a fireman go get a physical from a certain doctor. This has to be done before the doctor goes home for the weekend so you have an hour and a half."" 

Paul races across town by bus to get to the doctor's office. The doctor takes one look at this strapping, muscular farm kid and says ""well you obviously can pass the physical"" and signs the necessary paperwork without even doing the physical. Paul later realizes it wasn't about the physical, it was to see if he was sober on the Friday afternoon of a long weekend.

Tuesday morning he starts three days of training. Mostly physical fitness stuff. The last thing is the 'test'. The test is to hold a fire hose for 10 minutes without dropping it. The brass nozzle on the hose was 50 pounds or so plus the weight of the water and the canvas hose. It was a difficult task and most men failed. But Paul has been throwing hay bales on the farm and hauling lumber on construction sites for years. He is jacked. He has no problem holding the hose. That was it. He was now a fireman.

Over the years, he climbs the ranks based on seniority and becomes a Fire Chief at 50 and retires with a full pension at 55. (Now 85, his pension last year was $65,000).

Paul has a great life because of his job. 4 kids. Stay-at-home wife. He has a nice house, motor home, boat, vacations in the sun etc etc. All because he was strong and sober one particular Friday afternoon. (Plus the other qualifications of the time period - white, English speaking, straight & male).

I pass along this tale not to depress you but to confirm your feeling that things are different for the generations since. It certainly used to be much easier to get by and be successful. So don't let your grandparents get you down. It was simpler in their day (provided you were white, English speaking, straight and male)"	"2021-12-10 19:35:53"

"3464"	10	1	"To give you guys some context, I am an engineer living in Western Europe, I am an immigrant and I chose Europe as a place to live after I graduated. 

As an immigrant coming from a developing country I had my share of bad interviews with recruiting personnel (a lot of passive aggressive racism) and people actively trying to ""scam"" me into shady job opportunities thinking I had no clue about the country's labors laws.

But I had an experience that really marked me and I wanted to share with you guys, to maybe shed a light on some abusive practices of consulting firms.

So right when I arrived at the country I chose to live in, I started sending a lot of CVs, everywhere and to every position I thought I would be a good fit. After a few months I had passed a lot of interviews but with no luck.

I started then getting a lot of responses from consulting firm and I passed a few interviews (I got used to their system of filling out a whole new CV with all the details of my accomplishments and studies and every consulting firm had their own document to fill or website to enter the information, really a time consuming thing).

After 3 interviews with a consulting firm they finally said they had an opportunity for me, but it was in another country (really close to the border of where I lived at the time, so I didn't care to move closer to the job's location). I accepted and they said I had to go there meet their affiliate and afterwards meet the client to see if it was a match. They said I could buy a train ticket and if I got the job they would refund me full, and if I didn't they would pay me half the price. I thought it was fair enough (at the time I was more than 3 months jobless, so I can say I didn't have much to spare but I had to give it a chance). 

I bought a train ticket (120 euros) and went there meet them. Everything went alright, and I left with a good feeling. The consulting firm said that they would wait the client's response and would get back to me. Finally a kind of a good news (as I thought at the time). 

One week passes by and I receive a call from the recruiter saying that he is sorry but the client changed his mind and didn't think I was a match. I said, ok and now what? They said they had another recruiter in the consulting firm that liked my CV and wanted me to meet another client, again far away from where I lived. He said they would again pay for my expenses. I agreed and this time got a bus ticket (money running short).

Again I met another client, everything went well, really a good feeling between the two of us. I left and debriefed with the recruiter from the consulting firm, he was really happy and said he would start working on my contract and all the details as soon as he gets a definitive answer from the client. So after two days I am back home and I receive a call from the recruiter saying the client said yes, and he was working on my contract and all was good. I was so happy, and said that I wanted to discuss the details of the contract, pay rates and what kind of benefits for moving to the other side of the country. After I said that he immediately changed his voice tone and said he would get back to me during the week.

Time passed, and no call from the guy, I sent an email and no answer. Tried calling and no one answered, during this time I remembered the first recruiter and how he was supposed to pay me at least half of my train trip, so I sent him an email asking about his colleague and if he had news about when they would pay me half the train trip. No answer. I tried calling and no one picked it up. I didn't understand a thing. I kept asking myself, why would they ghost someone that actually got the job?

At the end I managed to get a job in another company (not a consulting one) a few weeks later. But this experience really showed me how recruiters don't care about you. You are just a number and a bonus on their paycheck if you sign a contract. I was hoping they would call me at least to say that they f*ed up and they wouldn't be able to pay me back or that they didn't manage to make the client sign their contract, it would be better than just ghosting/blocking someone that was actually eager to work for you.

Tl.dr: I travelled half the country and paid 200 euros to meet some clients for a consulting firm and never got my money back (which they said they would pay back) and neither a job offer. Got ghosted by two recruiters of the same company."	"2021-12-10 19:32:22"

Increasing profits doesn’t often lead to just-in-case systems being implemented, if the risk of damage is cheaper than the system to prevent it.

You're  an adult with rensposabilities. Don't get treated like you were getting  treated in school, by your teacher. E.g. Your boss contacts within your  non-working hours/time off and instructs you to do something. He is not  your boss within non-working hours, so if they keeps harrasing you,  then just tell him to contact you within the working hours.

I thought salaried meant you get paid the same no matter how many hours you work. So, if I get my job done in 6 hours, I should still get paid for 8. 

The other thing...I am required to work 9 hours a day (30 min lunch break, so really 8.5 hours). But if I take a vacation day or call in sick, I use 8 hours of PTO time. I do not clock in or out, and I am supposed to fill in a time card on the computer weekly. The time card is automatically set to 8 hours, 5 days a week and I am not allowed to change it to say how many hours I actually worked (45). 

Literally all of my coworkers work 8 hour days. Except the boss who works 9-12 hours a day. And comes in on his days off. He is a middle manager, so it's not like he's a big wig and should be working this much. 

My concern is that I occasionally leave an hour early for doctors appointments (working 7 hours that day, 1 hour less than everyone else), and ask my boss to make up that 1 hour on an other day. I ask to work 9 hours the next day (1 more hour than everyone else) and his response is that our company requires 9 hour days. So now if I want to leave an hour earlier than everyone else I have to work 2 extra hours to make up for it.

I'm waiting to be accepted to another job so this shouldn't happen again, but I'm wondering if this is wage theft? Discrimination for being sick and needing to go to the doctor?"	"2021-12-10 21:42:02"

For too long have the vast majority of the population been made to work in less than acceptable environments, for wages that most will consider below the cost of living for their location. 

This community is one where the people can voice their concerns, seek help, and share their stories without the fear of retaliation. This is a place where all are welcome to join the fight in creating a world where you don’t have to worry if a simple mistake will land you into poverty, a world where everyone has the protection of a union to defend their rights at the place they depend on most. 

This community is already having a big impact on the world, and the selfish business and billionaires that control it. We’ve been able to spread the word to the world that the people are going to stand up for their rights, and fight for a work environment that doesn’t drain the energy out of the people who have no other choice but to work for them. 

None of this will happen if nothing is said outside of this community. I encourage all of you reading this to take action, and defend your rights. 

Talk to your coworkers about your wages, no matter what is said to you, discussing your wages with your co workers is 100% fine. 
It is against the law to prevent employees from discussing wages. 

Push your bosses for increased wages. Make them understand that you require a living wage to make ends meet at home.

I just finished a microsoft teams interview with the hr recruiter for a call center position and this is why i’m crying:
1. the job isn’t actually remote. it’s in office.
2. i mentioned that i was pregnant. i know, not recommended, but im fucking huge. a quick facebook search and boom! you see that i’m pregnant. it’s also important in regards to my background info- i left my last job to go back to school and then i dropped out of school. why? because i’m pregnant and don’t want to be around maskless teenagers. she then said “i’m going to pretend you didn’t tell me that. don’t disclose that information.” i know she was well intentioned but it hurts. she jokingly went on to say “i’m going to beat you if you say that during the interview with the department manager.” it’s just so heartbreaking. my boyfriend would never have to worry about being denied a job for discussing his familial status. no one would ever say “i may not hire him, he’s going to be a dad.”
3. she looked me and praised my background and specifically said “your demeanor, poise, and communication skills are all so incredible… you know this is a call center job, right?” like… yes alice, i know. i KNOW i’m overqualified but i’ve applied for over 100 jobs and this is my first legitimate interview. believe me, call center wasn’t my first fucking choice.

The goal was to work there while I got my training and started my own dog grooming business. It's been lots of BS from day one with the department manager intentionally starting drama between employees and failing at communication. I dealt with most of that stuff. Just kept my head down and tried to my job with the 0 training and shit communication. Fast forward to this last week. I'm annoyed with dumb stuff but just trying to keep going focusing on my own business and how close I'm getting. A few days ago one of my coworkers was told -by the owner- that if she went home sick she wouldn't have a job anymore because they have a stack of resumes waiting to replace them. Honestly disgusting and I told my coworker she should have just walked then. She's young so she didn't and honestly probably needs the job cause bills. 

Now today. I go in for my shift at 11 and when I get there someone is finally fixing the dishwasher in the bar area. The one that's been broken and filling with moldy water for a month+. Because of said moldy water I had added bleach to it trying to atleast kill the smell and maybe some of the mold. Well the owner comes by and tells me I shouldn't do that anymore. I'm trying to explain why I did it and that I had to deep clean it last time- so I know how gross it is. Owner's responce is ""don't talk back to me just do what I say"" and that was it for me. I went in back to confirm with my fiance that we wouldn't 100% be up shits creek, took off my apron and when to the managers office. She responded that I was being disrespectful. I told her that I was done, her eyes got a little wide and she said okay go put in your notice and I said no I'm going home now. 
Owner- ""I've been doing this for a long time I know what I'm doing""
Me- ""yeah well honestly alot of your employees feel the same what I do and think your a bitch""
Owner- ""well just because you don't like me""

I was a trucking supervisor in the oilfields of Odessa Tx. I was field  training a man named J, proud yet kind man from Mexico.  J. Had a difficult time learning the computer system. He would follow me place to place, me in my truck, he in his. When we would stop I would show him hot to manage. his electronic logs and load manager. I did this for a week. He would always thank me for being so patient. 
J Kicked ass after he learned the system and was incredibly proliific. I taught him heavy haul securement and he made big bucks moving frac equipment for the company. 

J. Was dispatched to New Mexico, He came to see me and was a bit frantic, claiming he could not go. I asked how come? J. showed me all his paperwork, he was on  state supervision, and had completed 8 years in federal prison as a cartel member money laundering. . He had Federal and state charges. I re-assigned him to South Texas until New Mexico was completed. 

J. and I lived in the same man camp, we ate dinner together and on a days off would go out to eat. One time I asked him a couple of things about how he handled business in his old life. How he collected money if it was not paid, he told me a story that I am not going to repeat to anyone, he called it disappearing you. I asked J if he sent people to do these things? He said no, I personally took care of my business. I don't talk to him much about his past, the less I know the better. 

What I'm trying to say is. you might be supervising and x sociopathic  Killer and not know it. Best you treat everyone with professionalism and kindness.  I wonder how many people  who are genuinely trying to make it in the world trying to go legit after prison and they come across that insensitive self-agrandizing, arrogant power tripper pushing employees to the edge with stupid comments and unessessary disrespect.

I go in on my first day and they tell me they have no break room but only a private area blocked off by a divider to sit down. A microwave on-top of a cabinet and a mini fridge. Then they tell me I can put my stuff in the bathroom on top of a rack. 

All of their information and values about store policy is in the bathroom so during my orientation I had to stand in the bathroom to read it all and that not even the worst part. It's the only job here in Ontario that does not give you a break if you work 4/5 hours. 

I thought that was illegal because every job I've heard of here has a policy of a 15 minute break for a 4 hour shift. Turns out they are just extra crappy by exploiting the law. Turns out the law is I only need an eating break every 5 consecutive hours of working. Bet they wouldn't give us a break if they didn't have to.

I'm already tired of working there as there is no such thing as sitting down for me as I'm part time with 4-5 hour shifts and even while doing training on the computer I have to stand. Maybe I'm complaining too much but I even got better treatment as an employee at Value Village and that's saying something.

So my story is the follow: I'm a Journalist, that's my dream job since i was a kid, now I'm 30. I did all the usual step by step progress most of us do: started writing on blogs during University while doing some paper job on the side of studying. 5 years ago a local TV contacted me to work with them. Keep in mind I'm talking about a region where there are very few local news outlet (2 journals, 2 television and 2 online journals). I've worked for them for the last 5 years EXCEPT I don't technically ""work for them"" because I was never hired instead I work as a freelancer. That means no paid vacation no sick leave of course and I also have to pay my own Job related taxes. I kept my head down and worked my ass off thinking at some point they will hire me but, despite several promises in that regard, nothing ever happened and the pandemic hit gave the Manager another good excuse to postpone my hiring. Fast forward to Fall 2021 and on an unrelated matter the Journalist Union put a focus on the situation on the Company and noticed my unusual and unlawful working agreement. So the Company, scared about a lawsuit, put me on hold from work until my situation was normalized. I've been out of work since the start of november and now, after a month, they finally made me a contract offer which is honestly ridicolous: basically 1100 Euros per month for 36 hours a week and for 18 months only. The union told me not to accept and to sue the company saying I could get as much as 100k from a cause they say I'm pretty much guaranteed to win. The problem of suing is of course I would need to find another place to work and, as mentioned above there are not a lot of those here in my region and I would not want to move.
So I'm basically fucked either i accept an offer way below my worth or I go to trial with the company and remain unemployed. I honestly don't know what I'm going to end up doing and would love some feedback. Thanks all in advance!"	"2021-12-10 20:59:45"

I moved from PA to TX to help a ""friend"" grow his business. It was presented as an awesome opportunity with no way to fail short of lack of trying. 
My position was to handle all sales and some production. I was stoked! So I bought a home, gathered my shit and made the 1500 mile move back to Dallas, Texas. 
Dont get me wrong, I am grateful for the job because it allowed me to move out of my heroin riddled hometown. 
This position was described as a ton of money, future benefits and as much growth as I wanted. 
I am now one year in. I have grown the company from 60k sales its first year to 400k in sales since I started. 
I've landed several massive accounts and have never called a single day off. 
When I asked for vacation time to see my family: ""I cant afford it I'm a small business owner""
When I asked for benefits: ""I cant afford it I'm a small business owner"" 
When I asked for a raise: ""I cant afford it I'm a small business owner"" 
Last week he told me that he sold the business for 100k profit and new ownership will take over in the new year. 
When I asked about a Christmas bonus because I'm taking time off to go visit my family on unpaid vacation: ""you'll have to ask the new owner about a Christmas bonus"" 
I pulled money from my savings account and filed my LLC last week for my own business.
If you google this business and read the hundred 5 star google reviews, most mention my name. I am the only employee who has been here since the start and the only salesman. 

I have made this man more money than he ever imagined and he literally would not cross the street for me. 

To answer any questions I see coming about: 
Do I make commission? Yes but only on in house produced items. This is fun because since he implemented this program, he outsources literally everything he can. 

This is a soul crushing experience. I will come back harder than ever but after hearing 0 Christmas bonus for the single human who brought his business success, I'm fucking livid.

A trade association is:

“A trade association, also known as an industry trade group, business association, sector association or industry body, is an organization founded and funded by businesses that operate in a specific industry. An industry trade association participates in public relations activities such as advertising, education, publishing, lobbying, and political donations, but its focus is collaboration between companies. Associations may offer other services, such as producing conferences, holding networking or charitable events, or offering classes or educational materials. Many associations are non-profit organizations governed by bylaws and directed by officers who are also members.”

Recently, Starbucks as taken issue with employee unionization efforts. A labor union is:

“A trade union (or a labor union in American English), often simply referred to as a union, is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals, such as protecting the integrity of their trade, improving safety standards, and attaining better wages, benefits (such as vacation, health care, and retirement), and working conditions through the increased bargaining power wielded by solidarity among workers. Trade unions typically fund the formal organization, head office, and legal team functions of the trade union through regular fees or union dues. The delegate staff of the trade union representation in the workforce are made up of workplace volunteers who are appointed by members in democratic elections.”

In a year our owner went from 0 retail experience and no business ownership experience to owning 2 bike shops. He bought a shop that was failing and renovated it, basically just repainted. A year later he bought our biggest competition that is exactly 1 block away from us. In his words he is"" playing monopoly"". Except since we bought the other shop we haven't been quiet about it and it resulted in all our customers leaving and going down the street because they have more selection and better bikes. Big oof.

Here's the big pain point. When he bought the other shop the entire staff quit Except for 2. It was a shop of 12 employees. I tried to help him find replacements, like quality people, skilled bike mechanics and sales staff was the goal. I wanted to post about our benefits such as vacation, massive discounts, ext. He didn't want to attract pay chasers and wanted pure cyclists who just get paid on passion. He quotes this as being akin to a drug dealer, his words. He pays people with discounts and bikes and they don't care or realize how little they are being paid. I'm talking like 14-17$ an hour for 5 years experience and professional bike mechanic training.

So to sum it up. The new shop is now under staffed meaning the owner is having to work at the speed of 5 people. They can't bring in inventory or build bikes fast enough to meet customer demand. Our original shop is over staffed with 3 employees and is making on average 300$ in sales a day. We are now on credit hold because we have a cash flow issue. Bikes aren't being sold and have been sitting for 6-12 months, but keep coming in. 

I am now being blamed for not getting sales up or getting customer in the door. I am quite new at doing marketing and sales, until this point in my life I have just worked in inbound sales, call centers, and retail. I have never needed to actually try and get people to come into a store and buy something. I need a lot more guidance then what i am getting now. I am going 5-6 hours a day completely alone with no customers or coworkers in some days. I like to think I am a creative marketer, but having no one to bounce ideas off of is killing me. I could make a blog about anything in the store, and we have thousands of products. But not having the guidance on what to focus on just gives me anxiety thinking about it. Too much to choose from basically.

I see both these businesses just failing in the next year or so. I have seen the writing on the wall. When we have pallets of products just sitting for months and no sales it's pretty obvious. I also see emails daily asking for late payments of tens of thousands of dollars. 

On the good side I have been applying to jobs over the last month. I am waiting on one that will will be exactly what I have been working for. Marketing, union, health benefits, super friendly people. I just feel bad because I don't know how long the shop will last without me."	"2021-12-10 20:54:15"

"3645"	2	0	"To preface this, this is my first post on this subreddit, and I still work at this employer because despite the title I do enjoy the job to a degree, but I can't live off the income despite asking for raises and promotions many times. Names will be changed, no intended real-life connections for them.

So, about 3 years ago, I quite my abysmally abusive job at Kroger (story for another time), and got a job working at a dine-in movie theater. Let's call it... Reel Foods. This kind of theater, for those that are unaware, is one where you can order restaurant-style meals and eat them at your seat during the movie. It's rough at times, but overall fun. The pay was garbage and I was part time (still am despite being relied upon heavily), but I was in school at the time. It all was going well, had some good managers, had some bad, one that kept me until 2 AM when we closed at midnight, just to put cups away after being washed, which I always was concerned about because they were never dry. It was alright.

Then covid hit.

Lockdown lasted for a few months, and when we reopened I was one of maybe a dozen employees that came back, out of a good 50. Same wage, new procedures that wound up giving us less hours, and same bad benefits (no healthcare, free popcorn and soda on the clock, 30% discount on overpriced food). But it was okay in my mind because it was a touch and go situation. Then our yearly raises came in.

I got a ten cent raise for working during a pandemic.

We were furious. They had the gall to send out huge emails from the parent company thanking us for working during these stressful times and rewarded us with a raise that wasn't even half the average they'd pay. (25 cents for the average worker, a whopping 50 cents if you're god tier.) Thankfully, this was walked back on soon after because of the labor shortage, and we were all moved up from various sub $10 wages to a whopping $12 an hour. 

And things seemed alright again. Until this holiday season hit.

At first it seemed amazing. From Thanksgiving until the week after New Years we're getting 75% employee discounts, for the weeks surrounding the big holidays we get an extra $5 an hour and then time and a half on top of that on the holidays themselves. I felt like things could be improving. This week changed that.

I got my schedule in, which was my usual work schedule. Then, the general manager changed it, and cut me on Tuesday and Thursday. For reference, Tuesdays are big days due to a special promotion with cheap tickets and free popcorn, and this upcoming Thursday will be the day we start screening the new Spider-Man.

Despite being called the best employee to do the drink station by basically everyone, I was cut on the days I was supposedly needed the most. I'm planning on finding another job that can be somewhat more liveable (wish me luck on that, and tips would be appreciated, got an associate's in business technology) as soon as the holiday season is over, and I will quit this job. Thanks for listening to my ramble, and hope my story helps others get the courage to fight for better wages when I wasn't."	"2021-12-10 20:52:16"

"3651"	44	7	"I have had a migraine going on for over a week now. I had a doctors appointment scheduled for next week to get help with it and my doctor couldn’t see me sooner. Due to the severity of it at times, I was 5 minutes late to work twice this week. LITERALLY FIVE MINUTES when I’m usually on time. Both times were because I literally had to stop my commute to throw up due to the pain. I informed my manager of the situation, but because he “likes to run a tight ship” he demanded I pay $20 for a doctors note for those two days and get it before my next shift (today). $20 is roughly what I get paid for TWO HOURS of work after taxes. 

Anyways, I went to the walk-in clinic this morning before work. I had to wait until today because today is the day we get paid and I was broke after paying rent on the first. The doctor who I met for the first time blew all of my symptoms out of proportion (migraine, tiredness and red eyes from not sleeping well). He said that I needed to get tested for COVID and self-isolate until I get the results. Since it’s the weekend, I probably won’t get the results until Monday afternoon. 

Here’s the best part, since I only work 4 days a week and I was scheduled Friday-Monday I’m eligible to receive two weeks of covid benefits from the government in my country. Friday/Saturday being part of this week and Sunday/Monday being part of next week. The criteria states your eligible if your schedule is cut by 50%. So I’m getting $1000 to have a long weekend at home when I would’ve only gotten paid $325 if I had worked. 

After I tell my manger this, he said I have to come in because they’re short staffed and nobody can work but me. Then he accused me of lying. It felt great to say I’m sorry Sir but it’s the law, you’ll get your doctors note when I see you on Tuesday!

TL;DR: I was 5 minutes late to work twice this week because of a bad migraine. My manager demanded I get a $20 doctors note to excuse my lateness. The doctor forces me to get tested for COVID and self-isolate until Monday. Now my boss is fucked while I get a long weekend and paid 3x what I would’ve in government COVID benefits."

The current lead tech always speaks to me so rudely. Last week, a nurse called him out because she witnessed the way he spoke to me and he actually came over and apologized. I’m grateful to that nurse. He has not become more cognizant of how he treats me though. I don’t know why he has a chip on his shoulder about me. He is stressed and overworked being the only lead but he’s perfectly nice to everyone else from what I’ve observed. 

Today I worked at a satellite location and called him after my lunch break to see if he wanted me to go to the main hospital. He was grilling me about when I finished my last patient and basically accusing me of sitting here doing nothing. I finished working on protocols I’m building/improving (because image quality at this location is garbage), restocked linens and picked up after my patient. Then I went on my break. 

How can I confront this? Should I just be straight up with him? It affects my morale, I ruminate about it, and it increases my already barely tolerable anxiety. I’m not “perfect” but I work hard, help my peers and have to quality issues with my work. That is more than I can say about a number of my coworkers.

He re-hired an employee who quit on him several times, because they were buddies.

I had gone through several temp agencies who sent me on some real shitty jobs, I was a semi-trailer cleaner for a day, the work was pretty fun and I did a good job but I had to go to the hospital because of the unsafe work condition and the fact my lungs were burned by the acid they used. I was driven crazy on another job I was good at by my gold bricking manager who demanded I stretch a one day job into two weeks, while his bosses were chomping at the bits to get everything done in a week. I was a laundry and shower manager for helping homeless people where I was threatened, was stalked, no breaks of any kind and on top of that the bosses said, ""you don't need to get paid, the experience is good enough"".

In the end I just given up on trying to find a socially expectable job and just draw porn commissions, and you know what? It maybe a bit of a struggle I manage to cover my bills a whole lot more than playing games with employers.

Hell, I once remember my mom being upset at job hunting too, not even able to get a job at a fast food joint and this one place she thought they were telling her to hit the bricks because of her age, when the reality was is she's part Asian and didn't ""fit in"" into the office, they were all but just being open about it.

1) US conservatives were the vehicle for elites to push Milton Friedman's economics through Reagan. We need to reach an agreement that it has failed, and I think that's possible.

2) The nationalist right preaching hate is NOT a natural inheritor of the conservative tradition. We need to decouple conservatives from the nationalist right, not force the two together.

Fucking invasive surveillance with no empirical evidence to support it and the typical ""think of the children\terrorists"" messaging to try to justify it.

Furthermore, I am neither left, nor right wing sympathist (I dislike both extremes a lot) and just because you are far left, doesn't mean you are any ""better"" than the far right or the other way around. I think the communist utopia and chaos that some of you welcome is just as bad as what the extreme right people are chanting (various phobias).

For example:

> Black workers matter. Queer workers matter. Trans workers matter. Female workers matter. Disabled workers matter. And yes, non-American workers matter too.

> Workers are workers. Humans and humans. What part of ""Workers of the World Unite"" is hard to understand?

> Right-wing divide-and-conquer bullshit has no place here. (And no, telling right-wingers to stop being bigoted assholes is not divide-and-conquer.)

This doesn't fall on any political spectrum, this is just someone being an asshole - regardless of their political beliefs. You can kindly fuck off if you think only leftists believe this. If anything, divide-and-conquer is even more apparent in your entire post - ""either you are with us, or you are against us"". It's almost ironic.

It's about dialogue. If you think world would be better if everyone would just stop working, I can 100% guarantee you that you are sorely mistaken.

But if you know this is the case, start a Google spreadsheet (personal emails only and by invite only, don’t make it visible to everyone) or physical paper and get people to put the amount of years they’ve worked at the company, the amount of industry experience and their hourly pay. Tell people they need to be honest and that you’re going to try to get everyone raises who is being paid less than new hires. 

Ask for a meeting with your boss, give a really vague reason. Like a personal matter or something. When you get the meeting set, take the salary chart in with you along with everyone of your coworkers who is being paid less than the new hires. Have them stand around while you sit in front of your boss.

The boss will demand to know what the heck is going on and you calmly put down the salary chart and say, “We all want a raise to $23 hour effective immediately. We have more experience and have been at this company longer yet you’re paying us less.”

They might say, “Well I need to talk with X, or I’ll see what I can do.” Or say “It’s illegal to discuss your pay with others.” Look up the labour law code in your area ahead of time and quote it back to him, along with a print out about how it’s illegal for him to deny you the right to talk about your salary with others.

Ask them for a set meeting time 3-4 days later to follow up. Longer if it’s over Xmas. Then follow up with everyone showing up in your bosses office again. 

If there are enough of you, chances are they’ll cave. Because if they need to replace all of you, they’ll be paying the new people what you’re asking for but they won’t have your experience or knowledge of the company. 

Make sure everyone gets their raise in writing, retroactive to the day you first stormed the bosses office. 

If they won’t give you raises or not enough, say “That’s not good enough, Bob.” And walk out of the bosses office with your coworkers. 

Instead of quitting, you and your coworkers start working at a snails pace and don’t train the new people at all. (Check your employment contract, chances are training new employees isn’t in your job description anyway).

Once things start to get noticeable and the train starts  to go off the rails go back to your boss and say, “You know I bet giving everyone $23 an hour would really raise productivity.” If they haven’t already they’ll likely cave then.

They might try to fire you for this, so definitely have other offers in your back pocket. But if you’re going to leave anyway, might as well try some collective bargaining to improve your coworkers lives and punish your boss/company for not valuing their employees."	"2021-12-11 17:59:20"

It is an extremely common, universal belief all across the world to take power away from corporate bosses and more into the hands of the workers. It started from a left point of view but that doesn't mean it isn't popular among right wing circles, even if it contradicts other principles they stand for. Because this is such a universally agreed upon position, that is why this sub has exploded in popularity and the so-called 'great resignation' is sweeping across countries as the more that do it, the more that will feel emboldened to also do it, creating a snowball effect.

However the owners of this sub constantly try to pull a bait-and-switch on the readers here with this stupid assertion that 'If you agree with what we are saying here, you are a leftist', 'if you disagree with anything we say, you are a hardcore right winger'. It's just childish thinking you can recruit more people to your cause that way. People come here because they hate the corporate world, telling them that only lefitsts hate the corporate world is not only just plain wrong, it hurts your cause and kind of exposes the immaturity around here.

There is even an argument to be made that the constant attempting to frame the anti-work belief as a 'leftist' belief is in fact a reverse psychology psy op by right wing think tanks, because it deligitimises everything you stand for. Everyone can agree that work in the modern day sucks and wages are no where near what productivity has soared to. By unsuccessfully attempting to attach this common belief, to other aspects of 'leftism' just comes across as childish, no adult unironically goes 'you know what I hate feeling like a cog in a machine at my work, so now I'm going to push for the abolition of private property!' By attaching hard-core leftist beliefs to the 'antiwork' mantra, you actually prevent your cause from ever becoming mainstream because a plurality of people do not want unlimited open borders immigration, removal of all police etc. You will forever be a fringe, powerless group who preaches to the choir if you weigh yourself down with such unpopular beliefs by branding yourself leftists.

You can call this place leftist all you want, it isn't. Its very 'centre' whether you like it or not after the rapid rise of new members and you can't stop that. So when people come here espousing centrist views, you can't call them right wingers, thinking its going to make them leave or even become a leftist, because it wont, and you just look like children."

Who is the “they” in that sentence? The corporations don’t want to stop since it saves them money. The government is controlled by corporations, so they’re not gonna do anything.

I fear it would cause a feedback loop where palliative and elderly care would get less resources due to decreasing demand, making people in such care increasingly miserable and more willing to choose euthanasia as an option.

I fear it would eventually lead to a situation where, once you are incapable of taking care of yourself, the only humane option would be to choose euthanasia.

I think the assumption is that if you can’t work, you will at least be taken care of, but policies are devised specifically to keep disabled people in poverty in the name of discouraging people from applying for welfare. They are absolutely inhuman. Often we are simply left to starve or exacerbate our health conditions to the point of serious complications.

“It must be nice not to have to work” is something to say to landlords, not severely disabled people or people with chronic illnesses. In the current system, we actually *do have to work*, and we also *can’t work*. We are expected to tear our bodies to pieces and die in the pursuit of something that simply isn’t possible.

The emphasis on workers and working conditions is important, but equally important is recognising that the ultimate goal is a system under which *no one* should be forced to work in order to have their needs met. Anti-work, not only pro-good-working-conditions (though that is also obviously important).

**This post says that “disabled workers matter” but to me that comes suspiciously close to the capitalist rhetoric that you only matter to the extent that you can create profit for capitalists.

This sub, candidly, is just a lot of complaining about having to work.

I get it, when I was 19 I worked a crappy job making $12/hr. I worked while putting myself through undergrad and was able to finish with basically zero students loan debt. Then I got a better paying job and helped get my wife through her undergrad without any debt. Then we both worked better jobs and saved up and bought a house. Then after a few years of moving up in my job I went through a full time mba program while working full time. It sucked and required a ton of sacrifices. Now, I make $200k yr working for a local company. Not some F500 firm.

I am probably one of the dumbest people on Reddit, according to many. And yet I still just followed the system. It isn’t hard. Play the game and you get rewarded.

Not that we should tolerate bigotry of any flavor, but that this space is unwelcome to conservatives. I don't think it's right to assume bigotry just because somebody says something you disagree with.

We should welcome and educate people. If someone is incorrect or has a bad attitude, we can downvote them. That's how it's been. Bigotry should be reported and instabanned.

My concern is that a lot of people who are left of the democratic party are called ""far right extremists"" over singular issues. For instance, I personally find the employee vax mandate counter to the interests of this sub, because it is yet another tool being used by moneyed interests to exert control over workers but not be compelled in any way themselves. I would have less of a problem with the mandate if it was just a straight up nationwide law for everyone against the threat of jailtime (not fines, because rich people can just pay them.) There's a reason BLM and Trumpsters marched together against it, like 70% of black people in NYC are unvaxxed, and it pretty much amounts to segregation.

We can't call this a solidarity movement if we're going to play 'no true Scotsman'. It's a numbers game and we need to find a way to educate conservative talking points out of people and show respect to people who aren't being disrespectful.

I'm a part of a few minority groups myself and the largest learning I've had has been learning that when you are a minority, it is far easier (and understandable) that you will be more vulnerable to taking legitimate, hate-free discussion as being a personal attack because it is hard to separate the nature of our beaten-down perceptions from what is actually being said.

You’ve put a “right” behind the requirement to obtain a license. A license which can be denied, which means that person is being denied their right. You further add:

So by this you mean to say that it is *not* a right until you’re 18? How can something be both a right and not a right? 

Also by placing testing and licensing fees in the way of this right you have in many ways either priced out, or due to lack of free time “timed” out people in lower income brackets.

The answer is definitely, no, and giving them ANY attention at all outside of punishment for their crimes (if any are committed) would be giving them more effort than they’re worth.  

I have a theory that if we just fucking ignore these asshole and put down their criminal fucking cults, then they will cease to exist.  Their ideals are bullshit.  Their attitudes are bullshit.

Because the rich are happily willing to give us room on social fronts to give us a sense of progress instead of financial progress.

And I just wonder, do people like OP actually want economic progress? Or is it economic progress but ONLY if socially progressive thought is the only one allowed?

I've seen this exact thing so many times. A movement starts and the fucking purity police come in and don't allow any fucking progress unless everyone passes the tests and then all blue collar workers who are assholes leave.

One of the biggest barriers to abuse prevention is lack of awareness and knowledge. Sometimes, people are afraid of discussing the topics involved, or they think they already know enough about the subject. It is not uncommon for people to “ostrich” by choosing to avoid the topics involved in sexual abuse prevention. None of these normal reactions are helpful.

We're almost a year in to Bidens Presidency and we have no progress at on immigration (amnesty), free college tuition was the first thing cut in negotiations (reminder they were negotiating with Dems!!l, and cancelling student debt doesnt even get a response despite AOC appealing for it on the house floor. There is absolutely no reason any Dem platform agenda is being denied right now because they own everything. The simplest truth is ANYTHING  being talked about but not passed right now is because they dont want it. And it makes me so mad because they could grant amnesty and citizenship right now to millions of undocumented workers but they wont and the only logical explanation is they need to keep  them illegal to keep them cheap. But the next election cycle theyll be using them again as political fodder.

I don't like posts that attempt to police or silence free speech that is being exercised constructively and without hatred.

No. I am so god damned sick of this shit. Those poor workers that died did so because of the lax safety procedures by Amazon. Amazon has plenty of money and should take care of the families since it is their fault.   
That said we know they won't. So the families will get a lawyer and sue. Then Amazon will pay because it will be proven they provided an unsafe work environment.  
A tornado does not give as much warning as a hurricane but you do get enough warning to move to a safe area.

Moderator clamp down on reddit often leads to simply not being able to express your opinions and same think the extent that people with differing opinions but the same overarching opinions simply aren't welcome.

Furthermore, I have no idea what you are talking about with the right wing overtake. I have not observed that myself at all, so I'm definitely going to take pause before I simply accept that assertion.

I mean look at this post even. You in this very post are trying to overly lock down what it means to be a member of this sub to very specific beliefs you hold.

In particular Im referring to 

>This sub isn't for promoting Steve Bannon-style ""economic nationalism"" at the expense of workers in poor countries.

This sounds pretty blatantly like you simply believe people mustn't have any preference when it comes to benefitting their own countries, where you tack on steve bannon so that its hard for anyone to argue with you.

Also, yes, antiwork, economic and social issues all tie in together, but part of what makes unions work is that even though you may disagree on some specifics, you remain united on the main, important goals.

So I actually, apart from what I found to be a loaded statement with the steve bannon bit, agree with much of this post, but I definitely think going down the direction of purposefully limiting what opinions can be stated and how wide a net this can appeal to will only actually end up doing exactly what you claim right wing trolls are doing, by causing unnecessary division.

To repeat and rephrase that one more time so that I'm understood, of course you can't be so open that people with completely opposite beliefs are identifying using the same banner, but you also can't get so specific you push out otherwise perfectly reasonable contributors to the cause. What that means is that if someone doesn't happen to match your exact and specific definition you state in an absolute manner, that's fine. If someone agrees with you on the topic about 90% of the way, dont get mad because the last 10% isnt there."	"2021-12-11 17:49:19"

If you are a baker and you wanna organize your workplace you can go to the IWW and ask for the local to provide funds, techical assistance, organizing training to the cause and workers who want to learn how.

The Social Democracies of Scandinavia have done exactly this. Labor unions set the industry standards which is part of why they have a better quality life. In the US, labor laws ended up destroying the unions and limited their powers. 

Labor laws prevent workers from taking what’s theirs and gives their boss legal protections from the workers. Sure, we also get certain benefits but the benefits the boss gets heavily outweighs ours.

Union workers would get the union tariff to the letter, but nothing else, and non-unionized workers would get other benefits like dental insurance and free work clothes (that the unionized workers had to pay for themselves) and different yearly bonuses based on personal and company performance.

The owner [responed](https://e24.no/naeringsliv/i/k6pJx9/fratar-ansatte-alle-goder-hvis-de-faar-tariffavtale) saying basically *""I'm sure they're perfectly happy with the union plan, why else would they pick it? And if they're not happy with what their union offers then we have an alternative plan as well"".*

A day or two later the state owned oil company Equinor (previously Statoil) [responded](https://e24.no/naeringsliv/i/MLE8W0/mulige-brudd-paa-kontrakt-verdt-200-mill-equinor-kontaktet-tess-etter-avsloering) saying *""we have ethical and non-discriminatory clauses in all our contracts with subcontractors and material providers, we will immediately start investigating whether our agreements with TESS (about 1/3 of their gross income) are in breach and needs to be terminated""*.

The next day the TESS owner apologized and instigated policy change resulting in equal treatment of all workers regardless of union status.

------------------------------------

This wasn't even the prime minister or minister of labor or the minister of oil and energy. A PR spokesperson delivered some threatening statements to a newspaper and someone high up in Equinor probably made a call to TESS confirming that the threat was real, and that was all it took to snuff out this problem in a day.

As we all know inflation is guna hit hard this year, 6% projected and 1.25% National insurance increase to boot.
What are your employers saying about pay rise talks? (if you are fortunate enough to have these talks) 

We are unionised at our work place and are currently in wage negotiations. This is no small company, I think it maybe the biggest in our sector world wide to be honest without giving too much away.

We have put forward for a 7.25% raise to keep up with inflation and this figure has been agreed on by the union and all the members, this is much higher than most years but definitely reasonable with inflation and after working though COVID with no furlough as we are classed as key workers. After the negotiations they have offered 3% and are not really thinking of budging. We have rejected the offer and they are going back to the table sometime next year.

So my question really is how are your employers taking the wage negotiations this year? 

Cheers everyone."	"2021-12-11 16:58:57"
"4589"	12	2	"I put my notice in on Thursday to leave this company after 7+ years to basically take a lateral move, and my supervisor’s manager calls me yesterday and gives me the run around, and tells me out of our group I was going to get the highest raise percentage wise, with “12%”, to start 2022. I thanked him for the consideration, but I did my homework just before this call. I have known for quite some time that people in the same position and similar duties as me within our group make 15-20% more than me and bill out on average $10-15/hr less. The only difference is that those other employees at my level sit at his office and 2 other offices across the state.

So I was going to have those screenshots for this discussion only to find out that two other staff engineers with the same title and similar duties got 10% and 14% raises first of November so their pay is now 26-32% more. And for one project, one of those employees is billing out at $30/ hour less than what I bill out on average. Not only that, they consistently bill out to at a lower amount on average that I have for the past 4+ years. The information is there for anyone that understands revenue and profit within the company, in fact it’s pretty much taught in our first internal PM training class. All it takes is a few clicks on our project metrics database and know what the numbers mean, I’ve checked this method against my own salary and have been doing this for 5-6 years knowing nothing good will come of this . 

The numbers don’t lie, I had the screenshots on my desktop in black and white with these employees pay/raises  in big bold letters. Same activity  code (same position) and you can clearly tell without even looking at their direct costs to the company, along with hours worked, that they got a bump in pay by looking at their accounting codes that went up for the first pay period in November. These were not raises associated with a promotion. 

So I asked these questions. How as a company are we profitable if these employees are working on a 1.6-2.4 direct labor multiplier when that is far lower than the goals established by yourself and others? Why is it consistently like that across the board for almost all projects ran out of our group in your office? Why is it ok for some of us to be holding up the buffet with a 3.08-3.15 multiplier while everyone else in the same position within this group is eating prime rib? Not to mention the group in my office is only 7 people and there’s 3x as many people in his office and just as many at another office. How is it ok if 6x as many people to be less profitable than the group of people in the western part of the state.? If I’m so important than why is my pay considerably  below market and peers with same years of experience? Not to mention where I live is 6% higher cost of living than his office 2 hours away, 11% higher than the office at the state capitol, and 8% higher than the office on the coast. He wasn’t prepared. He stumbled and talked in circles and eventually told me I was right. He didn’t know what to say. 

 I also mentioned the group of 5-6 employees that under individual contracts under the same MSA that I work on that each make 48% more than me (2.12 direct labor multiplier), and we perform the same field duties, only they do it FT and they don’t have to deal with any other BS like being the safety coordinator, managing other technicians, or dealing with other contractor’s BS. I spent 6 weeks in the spring and then July through October working 12-14 hour days including up to 3 hours of RT driving each each day to do the same job as these overpaid inspectors. I still perform weekly inspections and was asked to cover a project under this contract 2-2.5 hours away at the start of the year. I thought our client rep was talking out of his ass when he asked me if I got a bump in pay to get in line with the others (he and his management negotiated with my employer to hire  these inspectors on as we got the contract and their former company’s contract wasn’t renewed and they wanted to keep these individuals around). He told me what each of our other inspectors were making because of the pre-contract negotiations. And I fact checked his claims out in the field with him standing next to me and he wasn’t lying. In addition to the metrics our project database, I also found a spreadsheet in the project file that had labor costs and billing rate. I was told by my manager oh they’re contract employees. Ok, quick search by employee shows that they are FT, non-exempt hourly employees, oh and yea they get benefits and PTO.   This is the one of very few projects that I had not seen the contract before I was working on the project. There was a line item for $130/day per diem for project personnel who travel more than 50 miles from home one way.  I had heard the contractors were getting this even though they are 54 miles from their shop and get to sleep in their own bed each night. I had mentioned that to my PM before I found out any of this in the contract and was told ohh I don’t know about any per diem. I was driving 80 miles one way, and still am once a week for one project until close out. Our client rep told me out of frustration after hearing disgruntled inspectors complain that they would pay for it but our program lead said they didn’t want to burden our client with these extra costs.  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BE A MEANS TO TRANSPORT THE MONEY!!! To top that off my manager wants me to manage their contracts, likely because there is no PM or admin time built into them so I’ll look less utilized at the end of the day by charging OH. I was able to bitch enough in October and got my per diem for the 11 days when I was out there FT that wasn’t yet billed, but they wouldn’t give me any back pay for the other months since they had been billed. 

So i told him I don’t have any choice but to leave though I haven’t turned in my signed offer letter yet. I don’t have to leave, just pay me and I’ll stay. But the issue here is fairly clear. He called me back 30 min later begging me to stay and said he would have to get justification to get me up to par, which could take several days. Whatever, if he thinks it’s worth it then go for it but I told him the numbers. He knows the numbers and they better line up or I’ll tell him to get righteously fucked. Perhaps it would be easier for me to leave and them to hire me back on at the rate I’m asking. 

I don’t know why those employees at the same staff level as me got those raises. After I saw their numbers I didn’t look up anyone else, I figured it wasn’t worth my time as I was already heated. It’s just odd that they both got huge bumps at the same time 2 months before anyone else. Some of the technicians and welding inspectors  in his office make more and bill out at a lower rate than me but they have 15-20 more years of technical experience, and that doesn’t upset me. I’m just comparing apples to apples, staff engineer to staff engineers. 

I love comfortably, and I am able to buy what I want. Save some money and do whatever. I don’t have to pay for gas to drive to the office as an office based employee. But at the end of the day 99 if not 100% of us work to make a pay check. I want the same size slice of pie. 

Disclaimer: I work in the engineering consulting business. I used to work in our Business Line lead’s office before he had this position and I  transferred to my current office in 2017. One of the guys that’s now making 32% more than me took over my work when I left that office and he has trouble responding to emails, removing left over data on reports and submitting said reports.  I’ve been told before that where is a different market than the one I left. I guess the only difference is there’s more opportunities for employment elsewhere there than there are here so they can get away with it."	"2021-12-11 16:57:26"

I'm constantly fatigued from trying to work that causes me to take a ""bathroom break"" every half hour or so, and last but far from least, to combat my fatigue issue I walk outside my house with a cane, which I put away when working.

My managers have seen me arrive with said cane, and I'm sure that because they see me working eight hour shifts it means I can absolutely do so at a regular pace. This is the furthest from right. I was able to cope with this job with aforementioned bathroom breaks, but I've been caught with them, so now I have no where to recover and that change has made me want to quit and find a job that would accept an easy to fatigue slow worker with big social anxiety - Which is of course, nigh impossible as far as I can tell.

"4597"	3	19	"So I had a crazy idea, just hear me out, why don't we form a political party with the ideals of this subreddit in order to start real change from a government side.

 I say this because even as a collective, all moving towards the same goal, unless we have any government support, all changes we want to enact won't be wide sweeping or long lasting. 

It's is also very clear that the majority of those in power right now on either side of the aisle don't respect the rights of the workers and that of us regular citizens.

With this in mind, I would like to start the Workers Union Political party. 
The main ideals of this party would be as follows;
1. Workers rights should come before corporations
2. More of a focus on helping with internal social issues, that plague us all like medical debt, student debt, lack of affordable housing.
3. Stop corporate subsidies.
4. Improving working conditions for all.
5. Non exempt corporate taxation.
6. Ban all forms of corporate lobbying.
7. No tolerance policy for workplace discrimination and harassment.

The reason behind why this would be a good idea are as follows:

1. All manner of government officials can work on enacting policies that would strip away corporate rights and start repealing policies and laws that have already given them to much power. 
Want to vote against a known worker violating chain coming into the town? you have a say with local politics. Want to vote against a known company buying up a shit ton of land to destroy? you can help prevent that at the state level. Want to make those millionaires and billionaires pay literally? State and federal levels have the ability to make that change.

2. Banding our movement behind a unifying figure will focus the attention more, keep the movement focused, and provide more lasting results. Right now everything  that is going on is scattered and there is little to no organization. Perhaps a leader or a figure head speaking for those of the people and the workers can help with organizing strikes, organize union forming and organize long term changes.

3. People are leaving their jobs at a trickle pace and in some cases unions are forming and unions are striking. But there still is a lot of fear for the average worker. Not everyone who wants change can quit their awful job, not everyone can afford it, or they are stuck in a ""the devil I know is better than the devil I don't"" mind set. If we start a collective movement we can reach those people. Those that are too scared and need help.

4. A political group like this can help individuals become knowledgeable in their rights. Think about a single collective resource that could be reached out to and given accurate labor law information so you know your rights. Almost like a universal union representative.


I know that the system is broken and needs fixing, but from my understanding, you can't fix a broken system from the outside, all these changes need to be made from within. Again I say majority of those with the ability to fix this broken system refuse to do so, so it's up to us to game the system so we can get what we need.

When bad weather happens all trucks are halted, power goes out( so most places can’t function) and nothing with move in those areas for at least a day because roads will be closed. So 2 hours of work means nothing when nothing can come in or out for 2-3 days. At that point a delay is a delay.

I used to work at a small-medium sized CRO company (consultancy research organisation, we are labwork mercenaries basically) where we would have monthly company-wide meetings about how awesome the company was doing, yet everytime compensation came up money was suddenly tight. This spring we actually got national awards for growth and revenue generation, so instead I got told that I was taking too much time off due to my child being sick (mandatory 10 day stay at home from daycare if they so much as cough, there is a pandemic after all) to deserve a raise and I should be glad they didn't replace me. This is actually illegal discrimination in my country. Still, they even let me record the meeting. That's how confident my boss and the CEO was at the time. I was even asked by a middle manager ""Don't you have a wife? Why doesn't she do her job?"". My wife is a physician. We're in a pandemic. I felt I was doing my part to help society by letting the actually-useful doctor do her thing but I guess I'm wrong?

Soon after I got invited to apply for a dream job, but one that would be a return to academia and require relocation to another country. I applied and somehow got it. And wouldn't you believe it; the salary I got offered was better than my current one. By quite a lot. 

When I went to hand in my resignation they where flabbergasted, told me that they'd already sold a project on the basis I'd work on it with my specific skills. I told them that if they matched my offered salary+10% I'd stay. Immediately they started groaning about how poorly the company was doing, that I was being unfair to the other employees and that I surely couldn't POSSIBLY expect to be worth that much. (People with academia experience probably know how insane the statement ""I got offered a higher salary to go back to work at a university"" is.)

They did convince me to make it a sabbatical leave instead of me resigning, but joke's on them. If I ever come back it will be at at least double the rate they initially paid me.

I was ready to settle down. I liked my work, and most of my colleagues. My actual boss was - and is - awesome. He fought for me, and you could see the shame and frustration he experienced when he was forced to tell me the things that his bosses decided about salary, work-life balance and such. But I had enough, and somehow I got a lifeline.

To the point: You will never EARN a raise means they will never give you more money because they like you. Or the work you do. It's always a calculation - do I need to pay more for this person to stay, or is it cheaper to deny a raise and replace them if they decide to leave. Remember that."	"2021-12-11 16:29:34"

In my last role, I was doing work well above my pay grade as well as the duties of other positions that our small company wouldn’t hire for. They constantly gaslit me to believe that even the title I had was a stretch, the money I was making was right on par with my peers, I’m a slow worker, a difficult employee, it’s normal for an agency veteran to only have 10 days off a year, it’s normal to work 50+ hr weeks regularly with no bonus. Every single pay raise I got I fought tooth and nails for, and when I started 4 yrs ago it was at a rate that is now min wage in nyc, despite having over a year of experience and a bachelors degree (in my circumstances, I really had to take the job). Because the company was small, knowing that 2 people I sat next to for 10 hrs a day were profiting very well from me while I scraped by really pissed me off. 

My new job didn’t even blink when they gave me  $20K more to start for less responsibilities and a higher title. At my first yearly review (just over 7 months in) I got a $10K raise and a $10K+ bonus after a great performance, that I was also profusely thanked for.

It has taken me three days to ensure that I conveyed everything I wanted to convey, in the way I wanted to convey it. Thank you. This is incredibly close to my heart.*

You know, we’d like to think of ourselves as civil, good, selfless, technologically advanced… Truth be told, we are none of these things. We are still uncivilized, primal, selfish, materialistic beings, with absolutely no consideration for each other, the environment, or the greater good. We are concerned only with monetary and materialistic gain, and with what others can do for us, not what we can do for each other. 

Life is no longer about the pursuit of happiness, of community, of spirituality, of knowledge, of everything that makes life worth living.

Life is about consumerism and soulless, egoistic pursuits that we will spend our menial lives chasing endlessly, under the fallacious impression that these things will bring us happiness. They will not bring us happiness.

If you dig deep enough, most of our problems, not just here in the U.S. where I live, but worldwide, all boil down to money. Money truly is the root of evil in this world. The Capitalist machine makes the world turn, and the wealthy become wealthier. The poor become poorer. My country divides itself. Our people are quitting their jobs. Our people are dying on our streets. Our veterans are dying on our streets. People worldwide are starving to death. Large corporations are outsourcing their labor to these starving countries to maximize profit. Water scarcity is rising. Global warming is rising. Animals are losing their homes and dying by the thousands. 

And so much more. 

All because of our greed. 

Yet, here we are, wasting our precious lives as wage slaves, serving evil, selfish men, blinded by a materialistic fantasy that leaves a trail of destruction in its wake. Our fruitless pursuit of pleasure only causes more undue suffering as we violently suck the life out of this planet, and give nothing in return. 

But the dime doesn’t stop here. Let me share with you the wisdom of a profound awakening I had early this year, one that has completely shifted my perspective on my life and the things I value in it.

I live in Texas. Some of you may remember what happened here in February. We got hit with a winter storm the likes of which have never been seen in the state of Texas. Temperatures reached well below -0°F (-17°C). I saw more snowfall than I have ever seen in my life. We don’t usually have such low temperatures, so naturally, we lack the preparatory measures to handle such an anomaly. The roads completely froze over, people were wrecking their vehicles left and right attempting to drive in it, the Texas power grids shut down, water lines froze, burst, contaminated, and stopped working altogether, our home lost power and water for days, stores ran out of stock, restaurants and other businesses shut down, and we were stuck. We could do nothing but sit and wait it out. This may sound like a normal winter’s morning to some of you northerners, but it was complete chaos down here. No one knew what to do. People died from this. People froze to death because of this. 

The winter storm passed, the temperatures began to rise, and the snow began to melt. Things slowly returned to normal. This event left me to ruminate on many things. I began to realize something. 

Most of us don’t know how to do anything for ourselves. We’re 100%, totally reliant on big industries and corporations to do everything for us. What do we do in the face of adversity? Think about it. What’s going to happen next time shit hits the fan? We will do absolutely nothing. I should’ve realized this the first time when Coronavirus broke out across the world, but I was too naive to see the sign in front of my face. We don’t know how to sustain ourselves when things go wrong, and if I’ve learned anything from these past two years, it’s that we can’t predict what will come our way, or when. 

This realization scared me deeply. At the time, I was a newly graduated I.T. student, just beginning my career as a certified I.T. professional. For the first time, I was actually starting to gain some traction beneath my feet. I had just started my first real I.T. job a week before all of this happened. I awoke the morning of—I remember feeling this sense of hopelessness, deep hopelessness, like I’ve never felt before. It was all-encompassing. I couldn’t get out of bed. I couldn’t move. I laid there, motionless, for what seemed an eon. I was alone that morning. I conjured the motivation to call my grandmother. When she answered, I couldn’t get so much as a sentence out, and I cried. I cried like a child.

That’s when I realized. It was at that pivotal moment I realized, I don’t want this anymore. This path, it’s not for me. There is nothing for me here—and my eyes were opened. The purpose of my life changed. Everything changed. 

I never thought I would turn into the person I am becoming. I want to devote my life to the Earth. I want to embrace minimalism. I want to learn how to be self-sustainable. I want to discover what it really means to be human. I want to fall in love with life. It is now my dream to live in a tiny home, to learn how to grow food, and to become an integral part of an Intentional Community, full of like-minded people who share a love of life, and of each other. 

I may not be able to share this with everyone. I may not be able to convince anyone to embrace the things I have embraced, but I know what I can do for myself, and I am going to work for it, harder than I have ever worked for anything in my life. I can see myself doing nothing else, if not this. 

Thank you, for taking the time out of your day to listen to my words, and share a piece of me.

The issue is, it's a warehouse job, they're notorious for being awful - mistreatment, awful hours, shit pay, the whole boring-dystopia package basically. Now whilst the pay looks quite shiny compared to my previous pay (£6.56/hr vs £10.25/hr), when I mentioned my new position to some friends and old coworkers, they've all said they heard that it's a dreadful place to work for the exact reasons I've just said, as someone who wasn't fond of the idea in the first place, I now definitely hate the idea of working there.

When I woke up I tried calling the store - They were busy and didn’t pick up, then tried the only managers contact I have they didn’t pick up. Keep in mind when I woke up the remaining time left for my shift was just 3hrs I found it pointless going into my remaining shift. 

So far I’ve never been late, always do what I’m told. Only been trained for 3hrs max and I’ve managed to mess up 3x the month I’ve been there, Doing long hours of shift work and having my rostered shifts canceled and re-arranged less than 12hrs before my next shift.

They just rang me about my no show and I gave them my reason why and they demanded a screenshot of my call history and a bank statement making sure I didn’t do a no show just so I can have a day off. I’m just wondering is this casual role even worth it. 

PS: work conditions there are not the best
-not allowed water unless you’re on break 

-In a 8 - 13+ hour shift I only receive my 30min meal breaks 

-They cancel my rostered shifts either on the day or less than 24hrs 

-They expect me to come to shifts with less than 8hrs before the shifts starts

-I’ve been yelled at for not knowing how to do certain things (I have been working there for 3 weeks and only been trained once, everything else I had to watch or listen to learn myself) 

-There are about 6 Managers for different departments and I only have contact with one of them. (Others ignore me when I ask for their contact info) 

-This is my first time ever doing a no show in my working career 

-I’ve been told to train more employees that they bring in every week 

-This company probably has the most employee turnover / in the time I’ve been there there have been about 6+ workers that quit 

-Yes I understand they’d be mad that I didn’t show up and maybe “understaffed” but they bring in 8 casual employees every week

-My travel time to and from work is 80mins if traffic is good hence why I didn’t do the remaining shift when I woke up. After getting ready and driving there I would only be on shift for an hour. 

-This is not my main job and they know that me being a casual is my 2nd priority job."	"2021-12-11 15:20:12"

I think if each worker added up how much had been stolen from them and all the money they would have made had they been paid in full for every hour they worked, they'd find just how huge that difference is.

Our store’s pretty small, and we have 6 different managers that serve in different capacities. The manager who hired me is a pretty decent guy and has been working for the company for a couple of years. I found out yesterday that he put in his notice; he’s going to be doing a position that he loves. That’s great for him, but his departure fills me with a lot of dread/ anxiety. It’s probably because change like this makes me nervous, but I already feel like some of the management just kind of tolerates me, and that he had my back. I feel like I’m afraid they’ll bring in somebody bad.

I spent much of my early 20’s in a ‘career’ progressive job but I didn’t take it seriously. I took every opportunity to travel. I didn’t own a house and my commitments were minimal. I saved up and If my boss wouldn’t give me time off then I quit. (One company took me back, twice).

As I approached my mid twenties I started to feel this pressure (societal?) to “progress” in my career. I moved to london, have a successful career and own a house. 
Covid hit and much of my old life feels like a memory.

I’m miserable as shit.

Why? Because (In a short period of time) I was lead to believe that success was about career progression, earning more money and being on track with you peers.

Now I realise that I was more successful before. I had no assets but I had friends, experiences and was making memories.. 

What is it with this system? I felt I was aware and able to determine when I was being lead along, but I was wrong. Now I realise that I was craving a bigger pay check, but each time it came it amounted to nothing. It had monetary value but meant absolutely nothing! 

Works seems to play such a big part in this. Do governments, managers and business owners try to portray this societal narrative to keep us all on track? Who REALLY thinks that we should just live to work? Is everyone just brainwashed or are we all having the same thoughts on the train home from work every night?
Is it really fair to let us fit our ‘life’ in to a allocated holiday window which is dictated by a manager?

Or, am I wrong to blame work? Is this down to a mentality shift now that we can’t travel or experience things due to covid?

I feel ashamed to be moaning so apologies for offloading. Im 30 and fortunate. Some of the conditions that you guys in the US face are outrageous.

"4684"	4	1	"The classical Greek and Roman Cynics regarded virtue as the only necessity for happiness, and saw virtue as entirely sufficient for attaining it. Classical Cynics followed this philosophy to the extent of neglecting everything not furthering their perfection of virtue and attainment of happiness, thus, the title of Cynic, derived from the Greek word κύων (meaning ""dog"") because they allegedly neglected society, hygiene, family, money, etc., in a manner reminiscent of dogs. They sought to free themselves from conventions; become self-sufficient; and live only in accordance with nature. They rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, power, and fame, to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, lives.[21]

The ancient Cynics rejected conventional social values, and would criticise the types of behaviours, such as greed, which they viewed as causing suffering. Emphasis on this aspect of their teachings led, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries,[22] to the modern understanding of cynicism as ""an attitude of scornful or jaded negativity, especially a general distrust of the integrity or professed motives of others.""[23] This modern definition of cynicism is in marked contrast to the ancient philosophy, which emphasized ""virtue and moral freedom in liberation from desire.""[24]

For those TL:DR skimmers, you're valid. 

After eight months working *""fast food.""*

I quit over a hat.

Comment your own, *""pettiest""* reason below.

- 

The following is for those who want to read what could've been my villain origin story 🤣.

-

It sounds so juvenile. Till you add every moment of hate and despair. Every moment of dehumanizing cruelty. 

It was 2006, just out of highschool. I needed a part time job before moving states. The plan was to work a full year and save up. 

I was promised daytime shifts and at least 20 hours a week. 

That quickly turned into 50+ hours a week and permanently on graves. 

Which stemmed from spite from a shift manager and her sister when I finally got tired of being sexually harassed. 

The shift manager we will call Twunt and the sister Twat. *(Like Tweedle Dee and Tweedle dumb.)*

Twat would spend her entire shift sitting on her ass. Making elementary school sexual jokes towards me. Calling me a virgin etc.

Every time the pies would expire. She would make sure to throw the cherry ones at me... 

Shift manager Twunt would schedule me around her sister. Have me do work duties around Twat and instruct her that I'm to be *""supervised.""*

Being a 19 year old I didn't realize how absolutely fucked this was. At first I just felt like I was being bullied and creeped on. 

Twat would drift too close as she passed by. Lingering touches when she did so. Leering at me when I talked to any female staff.

A good two months of this shit. 

One night I'd finally had enough. 

I snapped. But I become dead calm when I'm angry. 

Twat threw her last expired cherry pie at me. It hit me square in the eye. Some of the cherry filling came out and singed part of my lower eyelid and eye. 

As I held back the urge to chuck the spatula I was holding in my hand. I coldly spoke at her.

*""It's no wonder you can't get any dick since your shits expired.""*

She immediately went to her sister. After about 30 minutes in the office. Twat clocks out and leaves. While Twunt comes out and glares at me but says nothing. 

The shift went on like nothing happened. It was my Friday. So I went home and chilled and enjoyed my day off. Till I got a call at 9pm from one of my other shift managers that I was three hours late for my grave shift. 

Me being the anxious millennial that I used to be. I flew down there and worked my shift, even though I had woken up super early that day and had to work till the next morning. 

I knew it was retaliation. But I didn't realize how bad it would be. 

I found out not long after by walking in on another shift manager whispering about it to a co-worker. It was because shift manager *(Twunt)* and her sister *(Twat)*. Had a plan to get me to take Twat's virginity. 

A 30 something slovenly woman going after a 19 year old. 

It went unsaid. But that was why I was also hired. I feel this is true because the moment Twat met me she goes, *""oh you should work on my shift.""* Then all the sudden I was stuck working with her. 

Along with being over worked. I had the added luxury of having the hardest duties. 

Not only did I have to solo clean the grills but also clean the vats. As well as scrape down the freezers. Almost every night I worked. I also had to count hundreds of lbs of discarded meat. One chicken nugget at a time to account for waste of product. 

Believe it or not. I was the reason the ice cream machine hardly ever was out of service. 

Ever had to pressure wash sidewalks in a thunderstorm? Rain pissing every way but up and feeling the hair on your arms stand on end as lightning cracked overhead? 

I do.

I also know what it's like to have to be told I have to fish out a ten pound turd that clogged the bathroom toilet. Looked like a horse cock curled around the bowl. 

I almost got written up for using old vat gloves *(they go up to your elbow)* we didn't even use anymore, to fish it out. 

Yes I threw the gloves away and no I sadly didn't leave it in Twunt or Twat's car. 

After that my answer was generally *'no""* to anything extra. I did one of the major cleaning jobs above a night. And that was it. 

Some time passed and things calmed down a bit. 

One day I went to the river with some friends and my dumbass decided to cliff jump. I was fine on the first jump. 

Second jump, the dipshit tag along no one likes of our friend group pushes me. I end up jack knifing through the water and tucked my leg to late. Which resulted in pulling down faster through the water. My knee went straight through the muck. Rock speared my knee cap and shifted it out of place. 

I had to work that night. I called in, I was told I needed a doctor's note to come back to work... I had never called out before or even been late. 

I see my doctor. Who tells me a month of keeping my leg up is best. I was young and stupid and also full of anxiety. 

I went back to work with my doctor's note that stated no heavy lifting, period. That I had to stand in one spot while working. For one month.

So for a whole week that was adhered to. Only because Twunt was on vacation. My main job task was literally just to wrap the burgers etc. 

The moment Twunt came back she scheduled me alone in the grill on a Friday night. A night there was a football game at the highschool next door. I had orders for hundreds of burgers about ten minutes after I clocked in... 

She had given the other two cooks who were a couple their vacation. Making an excuse that she forgot and had her timing wrong. 

I get through that hell. 

Then not long after all the sudden we got new owners. Rules started changing etc. 

We were then told wearing a hat was mandatory and no facial hair unless you hair net it *(which realistically is understandable.)*

But they also instituted no unnatural hair colors as a rule. 

At this point I had a 15 inch blue and white/blonde zebra striped mohawk...

But if it wasn't really visible it was okay. Mine wasn't very visible as I was a cook and kept it all under my hat. 

No issue. Every manager but Twunt signed off on it. 

The night before my next shift I had washed my work hat in the washing machine at home. If you've ever work fastfood. You'll understand why.

When I took it out I realized the shitty plastic bill snapped in half. I got to work and was told I couldn't wear the hat as it was unprofessional. So I asked for a new one and was denied and told we didn't currently have any. If I wanted a new one I'd have to pay for it. As mine should've lasted longer than it did...

I was then told to use my personal hat. I said no as I just bought it and it cost me almost $40.00. It was one of those stupid angel sinner hats 🤣 that were popular. I'm not ruining my personal shit regardless. 

I was then written up and told that when they get hats in. I would receive one and that it would be coming out of my next paycheck. 

At this point I'm livid. I wasn't even allowed to wear a hair net to get by that night. It was either wear my personal hat or be sent home. 

I then asked one of my oncoming shift managers if I could take my first break. I was given the go ahead. Right in front Twunt. 

I do so, smoke a few cigarettes and I just get angrier. But it's at this point I realize I have an old shitty hat sitting on my backseat. I grab it and head back in. 

To be stopped by Twunt. Who informs me I am being sent home for insubordination. 

To reflect on what I had done. 

Which was leaving without asking to take a break. I informed her she saw me ask the other shift manager who said it was okay. We were in fact overstaffed as it was...

Her reasoning was that he hadn't clocked in yet. Therefore didn't have the authority to do so. He literally clocked in right after I did....

Mind you I'm raging but calm. I laugh and go, *""damn and I just found my other hat too.""*

As I glare at her. 

I walk to the back to grab my shit. As I do so I see a new hire in training. Twat is talking to them and says, *""we need to get you a hat.""* 

And opens a top cupboard revealing three rows of fucking brand new hats. Enough hats to outfit at least five stores. That broke the last goddamned straw. 

I left before I set the place on fire. 

I got home and of course was asked why I was home so early *(I was living with a parent at the time.)* I explained to them what happened and their Frank reply was to quit. I asked if they were sure. As we were struggling. 

They informed me that thier plans panned out. So everything would be alright for the four months I had left before I moved.  

So I waited till my next shift, two days later. I had ignored at least 10 or more phone calls and subsequent messages calling me in to cover. 

As their new hires never showed back up 🤣.  

I showed up for my last shift. On a Friday night. Football night. Out of uniform. 

One of shift managers who I was cool with *(who we will call Capt. Badass)* sees me and goes, *""thank fuck I thought you died. We are so short staffed.""*

I saw Twunt lurking near by the office doorway. Itching to give me a handful of write ups for not showing up when called in. 

I ignored Twunt and looked Capt.  Badass dead in the eye. 

*""I'm sorry to do this, to you. But I quit.""*

Twunt was about to storm out but Capt. Badass then just asked me why and if I'd like to leave a message behind. I said sure, told her about the above and then gave her my message.

*""Let that Oompa Loompa, Tweedle Dee lookin' fuckin' orca cunt and her doppelganger perverted twat sister, Tweedle Dumb as fuck know that I quit.""* 

Capt. Badass just says, *""They already know.""* Gives me huge smile and says good luck, that she will miss me. If you took the time to read this in it's entirety. Leave a message stating, ""fuck McDonald's.""

And that's my story about quitting over a hat."	"2021-12-11 14:17:58"

Quick summary:

I work in a medical company in Utah.

Our attendance policy gives you 5 unexcused absences in a rolling year.

On absence 6, you get a write up, absence 7 it's probation, absence 8 is your termination. Once you hit the rolling year mark, a day drops off. 

We get PTO for a day every 2 pay periods. So basically one paid day off every month, and those can stack. That's our vacation, our sick leave, our emergency. 

Fast forward to a coworker's email sent about 20 mins ago, here at 3am:

Hey everyone, 

Last minute kind of request here but I came back from lunch a bit ago and since I’ve been back I haven’t been able to get my pump to deliver insulin properly and which is frustrating because I just changed it before I came in today, Really trying not to go home as I don’t have any pto to use so if anyone has a t-slim pump and has extra sites on them please let me know on teams or through this, I would really appreciate it.

Do you have anything to add to this list?  


* When making agreements about your employment status / holidays / sick leave, make sure to get everything in writing. 
* It's ok to like your boss, but never assume this will always be the case. 
* Talk about your pay with your colleagues. It's not neccesary to do so every day, but checking up once in a while is wise.
* You ARE valuable to your employer, but if there's no risk of you leaving, the incentive for them to work to keep you will be less. 
* Most unions are really good for workers, and if your boss tries to dissuade you from unionising, you should be even more interested in doing so.
* You should NEVER pay to work. If you need a uniform / a computer / a phone / other equipment to do your job, your employer needs to provide this. If they don't? Well... Sucks to be them.
* Taking care of yourself is not being ""stubborn"", ""problematic"" or ""a bad worker"". It is necessary, and it is your right as a human.
* Know what would put your boss in trouble. 
* It's OK not to answer your phone. If they need to be able to contact you, then they need to pay you for it.
* If your work is based on signing up for shifts, remember that taking covering extra shifts is not your problem. Do it if you want to, but you need never explain yourself when saying no."	"2021-12-11 13:59:55"
"4701"	6	11	"TL/DR: I'm in a well-paying job, no degree, not much experience, but my manager and some recent mistakes are pushing me emotionally to quit. :)))

Hi everyone,

I haven't posted in a while - I changed jobs, got some respect in the company and felt less ""anti-work"". This is what I get for selling out loooool

Not to give away too much, but I've been working in a fast-paced HR role since June. I've learned a lot. Tried out some new things. Made some friends. Bingo bongo. I definitely felt happier than I was in my previous role

But the last 2 months there's been sort of a decline. I just feel awful and mediocre. I'm assigned a lot of stuff, more so than my same-position coworkers. And my manager doesn't seem to respect me.

He constantly compares me to the person who was previously in this role, pretty much saying I should do more to boost team morale and plan events and buy little trinkets and squ!rt glitter out of my eyes - Whatever it takes to keep the team in good spirits!!! :)))  Problem is, this team is so fucking disinterested in all of that, that I've been struggling to carry out those duties. I'm a fairly introverted person (+ a little shy), which I was very honest about during the interview phase. How I landed the job is still beyond me 

Recently, I noticed my manager talks to the other team members in a very upbeat and friendly tone, but doesn't even look up from his laptop when addressing me. He assigns me 70% of the admin tasks, despite 2 other persons having the same title as me, then expresses his ""disappointment"" and frustration when I fail to meet his borderline impossible deadlines. He sends me emails at all times of the day, as early as 5:30AM, and expects it to be actioned or in-progress by the time work begins at 8. Side note, I'm in office at least an hour early everyday to get my stuff done - It's literally that much work.

But this week, a few of last week's duties got delayed and I spent the majority of this week trying to sort them out. And even when I'm clearly busy with meetings or staff engagement activities or just handling deliveries for the team, he still sends me emails with deadlines like ""this morning"" or ""within two hours"".

Friday was my busiest day yet and I was on my feet all day, barely touching my laptop. I made it clear that I would be away for about 3/4 of the day - He was already aware of this since HE ASSIGNED THIS TASK to me. When I finally got back to my laptop about an hour BEFORE work ended, I see 7 NEW TASKS sent back to back throughout the course of the day. Half of which were due in the morning - When I wasn't even near my laptop! 

Of course, I'm trying to get it sorted and explain that I won't be able to do all of these until Monday. He doesn't look up or respond and I just... I just went back to my seat. I skipped breakfast that day and didn't have lunch until when I touched my laptop at 4.

I have never felt so tired and useless. I break down in the bathroom at least 2x a week and struggle to do my hobbies nowadays. I used to write about action and adventure and doodle these ugly af characters and read books in my free time and blog a little and some freelance copywriting But now, I don't even do any of that anymore. I get so frustrated. 

I woke up at 3am with the most intense stomachache, all because I had such a late meal. It's now 6am and all I can think about is a mistake I might have made at work. I'm sorry that this was such a long read, but idk who to talk to about this. 

I'm the only employed person in my immediate family (mom recently rage quit her job and is pursuing her hobbies as a side hustle - living the dream). I'm in my early 20s. Should I really be putting up with this?

I'm not sure what I want to hear, but I just want to know how to cope. Just typing this out has got me so emotional. Please help me - I appreciate any advice you can give me."	"2021-12-11 13:55:42"

At the end of phased return I was still struggling so spoke to supervisor who I don't get on with as I stand up to her bullying tactics she did nothing. Two days later I gave HR another maybe fit to work note and had just had occupational health assessment report so handed that to my boss. Nothing was done about the maybe fit note or the advice from occupational health for 17days but during that period I had conflict with my supervisor due to me going for a coffee to perk myself up so I could continue to work advice which was in the report had anyone bothered reading it. I ended up going home and took 2 days off work. When i returned to work I was told I would not being getting paid for the 2 days sick as I had gone over the policy allowance. So they take into account the 7.5 working days that I was legally obliged to stay off work and the fact that 8.5 days of my sickness are related to harassment/bullying poor treatment. Yet my supervisor was pinged 3 times not once did she have covid but they allowed her to work from home even though she dont normally work from home, and it had no impact on her sickness record.

In Australia, pretty much every company has to pay their staff according to the relevant industry award. These are long, complicated documents that set out pay rates, casual loadings, overtime,  allowances, dinner pay, everything. Pay rates are set to duties and experience levels ie a level 1 employee is entry level and does xyz, level 2 does xyz but without supervision, level 3 is a supervisor or does judgement stuff, etc up the ladder. This is all worked out between industry, workers groups, and the government. You don’t have to stick to it, you can negotiate separately between employer and employee, but in that case the law is you can’t bargain away your rights for money, and the benefit of the doubt is generally on the employee’s side. 

&#x200B;

If I want to know a pay rate, its all online. If I know my colleagues approximate grading, I also know their pay rate. I read a job description, I can guess the grading and therefore pay rate, so I know immediately if theres a mismatch in pay rate v duties when interviewing.

"4727"	7	6	"To anyone unaware, when the major social media organizations began banning people with insane misinformation in late 2020, early 2021, Fox News put it upon themselves to add a comment section/home for all of their advent followers, as Fox was, and remains, a key source for misinformation on topics that can kill people. I've been going through the comments since I discovered this incredible anomaly of group think and circle jerking, but constantly see the comments, ""nobody is working"".

Now, just to clear the air here, the unemployment rate is only 4.2%. This is an incredible contrast to that statement, as more people are not only working, but working more hours, for less money, with higher education than ever before in US history. The reason this 4.2% is important, is because it is far more inclusive than it seems.

In the 1960s, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 89% of families were male head of household, with 60% of spouses not working, specifically ""wife not in labor force"". Taking this into mind unemployment rate was 6.6% in 1960 as well. This is important in the modern day, as unemployment is based on two categories, people working, and people willfully seeking employment. If you are doing neither, you are NOT in this statistic. Stay at home parents, or ""wives not in labor force"", did not count AT ALL towards that 6.6% unemployment rate. 

Fast forward to nowish. Obviously the wife row is gone, but as of 2016, an average of 27% wives and 18% wives and husbands were stay at home. The number still sits around 20% total, depending on where you look. The overall point being, basically nobody is NOT working.

There is a naturally healthy point of unemployment that needs to be met. These are people out on disability or injury, seeking better employment, people leaving and entering the job market. We never want to be 0% unemployment. It is not only basically impossible, but also to the point of full indentured servitude. That being said, labor statistics hide a lot of data, and the unemployment percentage hides a lot of people. We are all working, if not for our families and well being, but to survive. 

2020 results have shown as high as a 47% increase in productivity from people working from home, yet jobs are firing people left and right for ""stealing time"". People are claiming federal workers are at home getting paid to do nothing. I'm sorry, but no one is doing nothing. We are all fighting to live. Workers that literally worked from home and overproduced in private industries are now becoming the most likely to get fired. Not because they didn't work, but because they got ahead of it, grew the companies, more than likely didn't get any wage increases, and have much less work to do. They made work a task to get done so they could live more. Instead of freeing them up and keeping their employment, they are being fired, called lazy, freeloaders etc. or, my favorite, being accused of ""stealing company time"", and all under the guise of ""nobody is working"". To add, obviously wives at home taking care of kids that had the luxury of present parents their entire childhood are today's Fox News commenters. The people who had statistically 300% more parenting and babying than anyone born in the last 20 years, are telling us ""nobody is working."" Those that are, aren't working hard. Those that aren't are all freeloaders. Their parents/grandparents being home all the time was a job for them, and isn't considered one now.

We were scrambling to figure out how we were going to handle being so short staffed when our administrator comes in and even though he’s a corporate person and isn’t licensed to do LVN stuff he can do CNA stuff he starts going immediately helping with anything he can help with. No task is beneath him if it helps the patients. Then he hands me his card and ask me to get dinner for everyone.

It speaks volumes when you have a leader who is so ready to get up and get their hands dirty. I’ve worked in so many places where the administration would never do something like this.

We also round time in 15 min increments. Which our company blatantly abuses. I'm in the process of gathering records to send to the DOL for a complaint I filed against them. 

Supervisor: So, management noticed that people aren't on the line running at exactly 4. On the 12 hour shifts you need to be on the line at your start time. Therefore, we will be requiring all 12 hour employees to punch in at 3:53 exactly so that we can round the time to 4. If you sign in before 3:53 you will face disciplinary action for time theft. Also. You will be required to stay until 4:07 before being allowed to leave. This will also be rounded back to 4 and any time past 4:07 will be removed unless approved by management.

Me: No, We won't be doing that. That is incredibly illegal. If you want us to stay an extra 15 min, just pay us for an extra 15 min. That's how this works. We work, you pay. You don't pay, we don't work. I don't volunteer my time for this place, you can, I don't. 

Supervisor: Excuse me?! Yes, you will be doing this otherwise you will face disciplinary action.

Me: Did you not hear the ILLEGAL part? Might I suggest you look into ""don and doff"" laws then come back and talk to us. I'd also like to point out that even with all the ""genius"" college graduates in upper management. your best solution to stopping time theft from the company is to instead steal time from your employees? That makes sense to you idiots? How do you not even look into the laws before you try implementing such a ridiculously stupid policy?

Supervisor: You can't speak to me that way, I need to see you in my office, now.

Me: Sure. While we are in there I can show you the laws and how wrong you are.

In the office I did look up the laws and show him. He was pretty pissed. He tried to write me up and I was like for what? And he said insubordination, and I replied pointing out the ridiculousness of an ill thought out and highly illegal policy is not insubordination. And it is actually illegal to punish an employee for voicing out against something that is illegal. He just told me to get out of his office.  👋"	"2021-12-11 11:55:24"

I work at the OG as a server. I've worked servering jobs for years now and they suck but I'm still in college and it's the only thing I can really get hired as. 

Anyway, in addition to the regular shitty nature of serving jobs this job in particular drives me crazy because management does not give servers a scheduled out time.   At other places I've worked you know about when your shift is going to end and when to expect a replacement. But at the OG? Nope! You have a scheduled in time (and they are real fucking assholes about being late) and then you leave when they say you can leave. You have no way of knowing how long of a shift you are expected to work everyday. 

Nobody else thinks this is a big deal but it drives me fucking crazy! It's nearly impossible to plan around your work schedule because you can't know for certain when you'll be able to leave. To me it really seems like management does not respect our time at all. It's like they don't care if we have lives outside of work. To me it's just common curtosy to let someone know how long you expect to need them. Not leave them guessing and treat them like they are the bad guy for wanting to know their schedule! 

I know I might be blowing things out of proportion but it just really grinds my gears. I know there is no real reason for things to work this way because I've worked at many restaurants where they don't! Why is OG like this? Who fucking knows."	"2021-12-11 11:31:21"

We have the power in ways that they don't expect of us. We may have caught them preoccupied with their fat wallets in hand, but, that may only lasts us for so long. As of now we hold an advantage, we are still as one. Sometime, whether it is sooner or later our grasp will eventually lossen, finger by finger. That is what they're hoping for, praying we back down without a trace of fight. If we do nothing else to solidify our stance and bolt down what is ours, it may as well have been a passing breeze.
 
So, what direction will our next offense come from? What position will we stand by as a whole? What will the next strike of our communal sword take with it? How do we use the power that we presently wield? What purpose must we unite towards for the future? We must stop this tyrannical oppression of out Civil liberties. Should we be forced to lay down and hope they don't shoot us? Must we once again feel the dreadful scrutiny of their disdain towards our existence? Must we always have muddled voices, dampened ears, stolen eyes, and burdened limbs. Sha'll we sit on our hands and take the lashing from the people who pretend to be above us all?

Now is the time for you to use your power to fulfill your purpose, your niche, the reason that you eyes have come across these words today. Bring your strengths to our table, because with you, we are strong. Without us, they are nothing. This is not our foreather's war, it is ours. We make the rules not them. Today is our day and age. We set the battle fields and if they can't bend to our form, then they will eventually break under our pressure.

For a brighter after-verse we must forge our boundaries to them today, or would you rather risk holding your tonge forever and suffering because of it for an eternity. Let's do something we can look back at and be proud of."	"2021-12-11 11:29:00"

I don't know if I am ever going to make a single dime from my music, through streaming, or bandcamp or whatever medium. Right now i am unable to find the time, mental energy and physical energy to make music anymore. At the end of a work day, which is basically 6 days of the week, I am left with no capacity to be creative and I am not the sort that can just sit down and be creative at just any moment. I am working so that bills can be paid and ""dreams"" of my loved ones can be realized, but it is hurting. I feel devastated when i look at my speakers sitting in the corner of my room collecting dust (nah, i clean them daily actually), never used to their actual potential.

Because of labor shortages everywhere I’ve been able to raise my Audio Visual/Ligjting Designer freelance rate from $35-50/hr to $50-$60 an hour and plan to raise it more with 0 consideration for if I’m affordable or not.
This is not just bubble inflated, I bought a plot of land in Decentraland and am currently incorporating it with an advertising experience. 
After that gets launched, I buy a condo, increase my rate to $70 an hour minimum (over budget for our industry but idfk) 
And use the extra time to double down on my Decentraland business.
After I see an income over $35K a year from the metaverse alone, I raise my AV rate to $80 an hour, almost unaffordable, and BUST IT on Decentraland. 
Once I’m making over $50K a year from Decentraland I go to $100 an hour minimum for lighting and video design. Basically unaffordable for most gigs so I can spend more time sitting at home - which is just the way it should be.

I'm a dispatcher for delivery (for now), and I didn't even get my break on time tonight. I took my lunch 30 minutes before I was meant to clock out and then worked through lunch.

Why did I work through my lunch? No one else was there to do it. Am I going to be paid the extra hour for management's penalty? Apparently not.

Also, the sexism in cannabis is astounding. My job mainly aims to hire ciswomen as dispatchers and cismen as drivers. As a nonbinary person, I'm constantly being misgendered and I can't stand it.

These YouTubers, that accept any kind of sponsership; greenwashing, companies that make money by wage slavery, companies that make money by child slavery; They don't care, as long as they get money from it. And usually, as long as it is not obvious within 30s of a google search that this company or that company is shit, they get no backleash. Hell, in Germany the biggest streamer whose main audience are young children to young adults could for a while do casino advertisement. No, even another top 10 streamer on Twitch could do that; The biggest Streamer, 'Montanablack' received backleash after a YouTuber called Tanzverbot *dared* to criticize them - because YouTubers usually have class consciousness. 

They would go so far as to support someone who had beaten their wife, namely KuchenTV. That person beat their wife 3 years ago - or at least it's as good as the truth because his now-wife made a twenty minute livestream crying the whole way 3 years ago & had screenshots showing evidence of a beating on her body. He also did things like continually criticizing feminists for more than a year - earning tons of money for it for basically slowly regressing society and enabling his viewer to potentially radicalize to right-wing views. Someone dared to call him out for it and he got basically 'trashed' by KuchenTV for being his ""biggest hater"". All this kind of shit of being untouchable would've been worked, if it weren't for another big YouTuber called ABK that bought up the wife's livestream. KuchenTV then did three videos; In the first he admitted beating it (with 20 minutes crying), in the second it was a professional statement video with his wife and he wanted to go to therapy and spend 20,000€ to a charity and then his third video.... he said that everything was *supposed* to be a joke, he tried to make a trap for this ""twitter bubble"" (pretty much his 'enemy', which he thinks that progressive people are only on twitter) and ABK. 

And then, hell break loose; now a lot of youtubers began to criticize him for using the topic of ""domestic violence"" to make some money with (in December) and some outright refused to watch him any longer (with reactions, that is pretty much another lazy content farming with advertisement that comes from companies with bad practice)

So yeah, this kind of developed into an example of how bad influencers just are to a specific case in Germany. I hope it did gave you some insight why I just *hate* influencers. Nowadays I just watch very few and got to read more and more lately, as YouTube has just become insufferable when pretty much everyone just *reacts* or does some kind of unhelpful ""I pay 1000€ for someone only helping them temporarily and then receive 10000€ from this video"" - it's like the next big rich capitalist get-quick-rich scheme"	"2021-12-11 10:48:35"

Now my boss made it clear that I should not waste my time asking for extra hour payment if I stayed longer upon request as she clearly stated to me “30min extra is not worth my attention; come to me about this when you work a good couple of hours beyond” so I was late to my late classes or even wasn’t able to make it. Beyond that, when I told her about my limited time to study, I swear she made me stay more time just so I would be late. Asking for vacations or sick days was beyond painful to say the least. I went to my general practitioner and then she would ask me to go to hers only to end up having more or less the same result which she was not happy about. she would make me come in for events on weekends as well, full time no pay. To make things short, I eventually fucked up by going to (you guessed it) HR. Well I was told shortly that my contract, which is renovated every 2 years, would not be taken care of anymore and the rest of the period of my contract I would be let go; it so happens to be that time.

I studied all my life because I wanted to be a doctor. Elementary school, middle school, high school. Best grades everywhere, school awards, 1st positions in science competitions even on a national scale. I apply for medical university, get with high scores, then proceed to get a degree with honours and whatnot. I have spilled my blood on books, gave up my youth, gave up a normal life all for the sake of a better future, since my family has always been not so well off. Then I apply and get into the specialty I have always dreamed of. And here I am now. Do you know how much I make?

1600€ per month for somewhere between 160-180 hours of work monthly. Also, I have to pay 500€ + 200€ in expenses for accomodation, so I actually earn 800€. This is one of the cheapest accomodation I could find in one of the cheapest city. All my life for this. Yes you could argue with me that this is temporary, after this 4 years period things will be better. But actually if you talk to other doctors the truth is that this grind does not actually really stop anytime soon and that It might even quite some time before I actually can settle down with a good pay.

And do you know what's the funniest thing? I am lucky. I actually love my job and at least I do earn some money, all the people I know are actually in a worse place than me. This is the state of the country I live in, Italy. The only people I know that actually are in a good place right now are those who were born rich from the start.

""hey teams, reach out to team members and figure out ways to incentivize them""... So they did.

""oh, how about a free hat every couple of months"" was the only idea anyone could bring up. Really? I was quite upset with the hours reductions still so I was avoiding the conversation.

So I’ve been out of work sick for awhile due to some chronic health issues I have flaring up. I’ve kept my manager updated on the situation since I’ve been gone. I have notified her that I will not be able to return until I am able to get back on insurance (in the middle of applying) and see a doctor. I also mentioned I’d be able to provide documentation from said doctor excusing my absences and explaining my need for the time off. 

After explaining these things, she responded with the last thing she said to me (direct quotes):

*”I don’t know if I can wait more k need the hours for some one also”*

*”Put your  request please because if not I’m have to do separation for you”*

I have yet to hear from her for nearly a week, but the day after our last interaction, she changed my schedule for the entire month, wiping me off of it aside from two Wednesdays, which I am scheduled for.

I contacted the head of HR, who referred me to a member of their team. I wanted to get some clarity on my current employment status, and to notify them of my current situation of requiring unpaid leave to take care of myself. And I mentioned the same thing as before: once I am insured, I can get documentation.
They first gave me their phone number and told me to call when I had the chance. I told them I preferred to communicate via email. They then said there was nothing they could do for me and to stay in contact with my manager (who has not responded to me). They also told me to contact another member of HR, who handles our specific store. I asked for said member’s work email, as I want everything documented.

I have a lot of issues with the company I work at. After a year from hell, they’re only giving us a 70 cent raise across the board, despite profits being outrageous. We still are working extreme amounts of overtime and I’m consistently taking on other jobs. I have interviews next week and am in the “fuck this place. One more inconvenient thing I’m walking out” mentality. But the paternity leave was nice.

This issue isn’t even with my company. It was my older, a couple years away from retirement coworkers. I took my paternity leave after my son was born, and when I got back, I got shamed? Ridiculed? 

“We didn’t have that. We went to work and sucked it up”
“Must have been nice to have a long vacation”
“Wish I could do nothing for a month and a a half.”
“The mother is the only one who has to be there. You gotta make the money. We’ve been here picking up your slack while you’ve been cozy at home getting paid.”
“Why do you need bonding leave? Kids not going to remember this anyway.”


Aside from the blatant sexism, why is this normal? I’m sorry that they didn’t have that for you. But why is it a bad thing?

"4782"	26	3	"Whenever there are protests or pro-worker policy proposals, people go to bat for small businesses. After all, the mom-and-pop store seems so much friendlier than the transparently evil megacorp. You might know someone who self-identifies as a small business owner.

But workers and employers do not have the same interests, and this applies to small businesses too, often moreso.

According to the [NFIB](https://www.nfib.com/content/resources/infographic/infographic-the-benefits-of-working-for-a-small-business/) 38% of small businesses offer a retirement plan, and 25% offer dental. This is a point of pride for them.

But 95% of large firms offer a retirement plan and 89% offer dental. This pattern continues in [pretty much every area](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-2/employment-based-health-benefits-in-small-and-large-private-establishments.htm), small business workers are less likely to get [overtime pay](https://www.nfib.com/assets/NFIB-Employee-Compensation-and-Small-Business.pdf), less likely to have paid leave, the list goes on and on.

**Workers and employers have opposite interests.** The more a business pays their workers, the less profit the employer makes. This is true in large businesses and small businesses, but large businesses operate a scale where they can afford to pay workers in a way that small businesses claim to be unable to. Large businesses are also usually the targets of worker organizing, because they have more employees, and thus more people who might decide to unionize, so larger firms are more likely to be union.

Small Business owners are still capitalists, they're still employers, they still have employer class interests, and unlike small-business workers, they are very organized. In every small town, small business owners have a Chamber of Commerce, which serves the same function a union would serve for the working class, but for the employing class. At the national level, they have massive lobbying power, and they have waged an extremely successful propaganda campaign to get everyone to love them. Criticizing small businesses in the US is political suicide regardless of party.

As a result of this enormous political power, concessions won in government for labor have almost always exempted small businesses. Many places require that firms with more than 500 employees offer certain benefits. **This solely benefits employers at the expense of workers, who get fewer benefits.**

The working class and the employing class have no common interests. **If it's good for them it is almost certainly bad for us**. You might say that there are sensible reasons to want small business exemptions; they make it easier to start a business, and competition is good for consumers, keeps prices down and all that, but make no mistake these still come back to benefitting employers at the expense of workers. But these are still pro-employer. The people who start businesses got the money needed for upfront costs somehow, their propaganda makes it seem like they start out like us, but that's extremely rare. If you're rich enough to start a business, you probably don't actually have to work for a living. Some worker is going without healthcare, so that a business major fratboy can ask his dad for slightly less money to finance his startup.

The employing class includes Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, but it also includes anyone who makes a living by owning things and profiting off the labor of others. This is true even if they also help out in the shop; unless their hourly pay is the same as a worker, they are profiting off of your labor.

I remember reading about a lady who owned a coffee shop complaining that she was having to do things by herself because she had no employees and was offering 14 dollars an hour. Some workers might be tempted to feel solidarity with her. After all, she's helping in the shop, doing the same repetitive actions a worker would do. But she's taking home a lot more than 14 dollars an hour. If a drink costs seven dollars, she probably makes back the 14 dollars she would pay a hypothetical worker with 3 drinks, accounting for ingredients and maybe any payments still being made on the means of making coffee. You definitely sell more than three drinks an hour if you work in a coffee shop, and she takes home all of it. If she had two workers, she would subtract the price of two drinks for every hour they work to give to them, and keep the rest, almost certainly a lot more than the value those workers generated.

It's the same exploitative relationship that workers have with Walmart or Amazon, but with a human face, which is usually worse because they take anything that hurts their profits way more personally than even the most zealous manager. Why? Because your bathroom breaks cost mom-and-pop money, which usually isn't the case for even the most zealous large-firm manager (whose pay is unaffected by bathroom breaks.)

Thank you for coming to my ted talk. The working class and the employing class have nothing in common.

"4783"	13	1	"I have a (former) friend who did some shit I still think about almost every day—next-level gaming the system. 

Many years ago, I and my friends played regularly in video game tournaments around our state and surrounding states. Well, one Saturday I had registered for a local event, but my teammate had something come up at the last minute and couldn’t make it. The entry fee was already paid, so I was not keen on throwing that away. Accordingly, I began reaching out to people within driving distance to try to track down a spontaneous partner. It didn’t take long before a friend responded that he could do it. He said he had to work, but he would still be able to do it. I was confused because I knew he worked at a major chain retailer. I asked him how that was going to work, since the goal of any event like this is to play as long as possible (since that means you’re into the money placements). His response: “Don’t worry about it. I’ll be able to play all day.” Skeptical but intrigued, I agreed. 

The next morning, he showed up to the site ready to go. He wasn’t in his work clothes or anything. I thought it was odd, but I wasn’t overly concerned with the details. We played our morning rounds, and they went as well as one could hope. When it was time to break for lunch, I asked him if he wanted to go grab a pizza. He said, “No, I have to go to work for a bit.”

This worried me because we had more matches in the afternoon, so I pressed for more details. As I walked with him to his car, he was very evasive with his explanation. We got to the car, and I could see his vest and name tag in the passenger seat. At that point I became pretty emphatic that he needed to tell me wtf was going on because I didn’t want to get stood up for the afternoon bracket. So he told me. 

This dude went to work at the start of his grocery shift and clocked in. Then he smooth left the store. He then went across town to the tournament to meet me. He was now heading back to the store to clock out for lunch. He would eat lunch there in the break room; then he would clock back in and return for the tournament. 

I was, again, skeptical of the story. I worked for a different big box store for a few years, and I knew that would be caught immediately if we tried it there. But he assured me it wasn’t the first time. He had determined a certain set of management that, when they all worked the same weekend day, never paid attention to his department/role. He did some version of this every time this set of supervisors was in the store. 

Well, sure enough, he left to go swipe the time clock and then came back in about 45 minutes. Just like he said he would. I don’t remember how the tournament went; we didn’t win. But I never forgot the time clock thing. It stuck with me, and that’s why it was so hilarious when this friend pulled off something even better several years later. 

He basically perfected some aspects of his technique by fleecing the major chain store. But eventually he did quit and took a “better job,” one he thought was actually worth attending…

…for a while. 

His job was in a nearby factory. This factory is run by another major international corporation—a company that manufactures and distributes components used in all kinds of industries. His job, though, was in a sector that manufactured small electronic components. Furthermore, this was a 24/7 factory with 3 full shift changes throughout the day. So needless to say, there was a LOT of changeover and foot traffic at every break time and shift change. Combined with the large number of people, the turnover was also quite high. The job definitely seemed to wear people down quickly, and my fried was no different. Eventually, he decided to try to revisit his old time theft scheme, only dialed up even more. If he got caught, he got caught. No big deal because he was ready to quit, anyway. 

Well, this is what he started doing:

He showed up every morning at the scheduled start time. He blended into the massive crowd clocking in and out for the day. He would swipe his badge and then just exit the building with the crowd that was leaving for the day. 

At the “end of his shift,” he would basically go do the same thing, only in reverse. The workers were so compartmentalized and anonymous, no one knew or encountered anyone from other areas of the factory. 

He did it for a week and expected he would get caught in no time. Then a week turned into two weeks. Then three. Then a month. 

For three months he did this without a single ounce of questioning or detection by anyone or anything. Eventually, though, he got super paranoid about it, and he was stressing heavily about the prospect of eventually getting caught, and how the more he “stole,” the more serious the punishment would be. So he just stopped going altogether. 

After two days of that, someone called him to fire him. They said two-consecutive no-shows was automatic termination. He was to return his work equipment/uniform within 7 days or the cost would be deducted from his final paycheck. I often wondered how long he could’ve gone. Either way, it’s a pretty cool story."

"4789"	13	10	"Bit of background: I work for a huge company that makes about $11.5 billion globally. We were deemed ""essential"" during the pandemic (which...we definitely aren't). The particular department I worked in for 5 long years (until a couple months ago) is classified by the company as ""mission critical"", meaning we work on-site 24/7 throughout the entire year: weekends, holidays, front-end of week (Sun-Wed) 1st/2nd/3rd shift, and back-end of week (Wed-Sat) 1st/2nd/3rd shift. Taking time off is very difficult as they only accept a certain number of PTO requests per shift.

Essentially, this department is a warehouse position mixed with many other responsibilities within the company. I am NOT exaggerating when I say new hires have to learn about 7 different job functions to be successful within the department (with one of the lowest pay-grades in the entire company). And, yes, the turnover rate is about as terrible as you imagine.

They gutted our department in the summer of 2020. Work began to fall behind in all functions the department is responsible for (no way?). Thing is, we support several other critical departments. When we fall behind, EVERYONE falls behind.

Our just *brilliant* management team decides the answer to all of our problems was a 2-prong solution: 1) create ""team leads"" to help the management team in their responsibilities, and 2) put the entire department through ""LEAN"" training.

The first change isn't the meat of my story (which is turning out to really just be a rant about this special hell, my apologies), but I wanted to touch a little on it because all it did was take away our ground-level WORKERS (further shrinking our labor), give them a menial promotion for a whole lot of extra stress/duties, and make our real supervisors much less visible (I only saw my supervisor once or twice a WEEK). Management was allowed to work from home most days. These poor new team leads were basically now acting management without the pay and perks. Many of them left the company within two months.

The LEAN training really got to me. Even being so behind, they scheduled the entire department in staggered shifts for a 2-hour LEAN course. Taking each person off the floor for 2 hours...huge, huge loss of labor hours. Why? WHY? But the worst of it was, the management team presented this course to us, the on-site workers, virtually via Zoom from their homes. There were SO MANY technical problems. They had to get all of the rooms set up (cause only 3 people max could be in each conference room due to distancing guidelines), and when that was finally all done we had a hard time hearing most of the presentation, and the videos were very fuzzy. Ironically, these videos all talked about how WE THE SEVERELY UNDERSTAFFED team needed to think about our daily processes to find ways to be more efficient. One of these videos literally criticized a worker for turning around to grab a spare part from a drawer behind them. I wanted to die.

If that's not insulting enough, we never had supplies needed for our jobs. We always asked for necessary tools to be placed closer to our work stations and management always replied that we'd just have to make do. One of my coworkers told them to reorder something she needed and they never did because ""they couldn't figure out where they ordered it before"" (???) and she, of course, eventually ran out with no support from management. She ending up purchasing her own supply!

To me, it really felt like management was merely trying to place blame on us for being so far behind. The LEAN course was an absolute joke. They were acting like we are machines. You cannot optimize every single second of your work day. Not just because of all of the responsibilities and lack of proper supervisor support, but also because there are unforeseen obstacles that happen daily which will demand an unoptimized work-around. And most of the rules and red tape and hoops they make us jump through simply to do the work they expect of us aren't ""LEAN"" by their own standards. I'd argue a lot of it is contradictory (i.e., to do one task you must forgo another like basic prioritization demands, but then the boss hammers you with ""*Why couldn't you simply get both done?""*).

Luckily for me, I am no longer in that department. But I just wanted to say, employers do no care about you. This job broke me for the last year. I was so stressed and literally forgetting to eat. I'd have to find somewhere private to cry on the job. I started taking an anti-depressant, anti-anxiety medication. If management starts to nickel and dime you for every single second you work for them, or if they gut your department in an effort to be ""LEAN"", please, please, please take my advise and leave.

I am very sorry for the long post. Wasn't expecting to write this much, but the venting helps. DOWN WITH WORK.

EDIT: I also want to give a better picture of the horrid working conditions. The warehouse has no AC in summer, no heat in winter. Some of the summer days got to about 90 degrees. We basically had to wear long sleeves and long pants though, because there was a mosquito problem. At one point, I had about 6 bites on one leg, 4 on the other. In the winter, we'd work with big, puffy coats and hats on. We had to go in every day to work in these conditions. On top of that, for about two months management decides they're not accepting any new PTO requests  because the department was so far behind (and if we couldn't use our PTO over 40 hours by end-of-year, they wouldn't roll over into next and we'd lose that time). Of course, management could take all the vacation they wanted. Absolutely horrendous."	"2021-12-11 09:37:59"

Now I'd like to go on to the matter I truly want to get to. A post I saw today about Activision Blizzard. Now i dont think anyone is really surprised that actizzard would send out an intimidating letter like that, theyve done it before over other issues so its really no surprise that they would try and stamp down any hope of improvement in their fields. I mean in their offices. By the way, I have one of those ems to smoke but wouldnt you know it, I dont have a match.

Anyways, I was just thinking to myself, ""gee thems some pretty big words coming from a company with how many lawsuites? Maybe they need a taste of just what the 4th Amendment can do!""

Anyone got a match? Seriously its like I'm surrounded by smokers here someone has GOT to have a spare.

So why don't we brainstorm a little? How can we send a message to Activision Blizzard that no, its not their employees that need to consider the consequences, but instead, its their asses in the cross hairs, though its possible they already know. Best idea I have is to just make this your last month subscribed to one of their pay to plays or if you stop buying their loot boxes? I mean, the only way to really show civil discontent for these practices is to hist their wallets... but then theyd take it out on the employees... I mean, its already a crummy company to work at already.... I mean, if it got any worse would the employees walk out? I mean, its not our objective to bait employers into doing things hat would cause their employees to take action... Not our goal to force changes in the broken system.....

I had enough working for someone else and want to have my own little business aka a cafe and I'm seeking your feedback on my idea. 

So given that I can't be bothered to work for someone else, I think I'm not the only one and I don't want to make others feel the same, I.e. that they cannot be bothered to work for me. 

Instead of having the common practice of I'm the boss and I'm the one hiring staff, I want my staff to become part of being the business owners, meaning they will directly benefit if the business is going well as they will get some cut of the profits. 

I want to show 100% transparency in the finances to all staff members  and will share all takings and expenses.

Now there will be fixed costs for renting, paying down the equipment. This will need to be covered by takings. There will be also variable expenses like power, gas and water bills. They will also need to be covered. 

I'm thinking that the fairest way of managing the finances is to pay everyone minimum wage (myself included) then pay all the fixed and variable costs and whatever is left, so the profits, will be split equally among all staff members.

If the business goes well, we can collectively decide to increase our salaries over time but at the end, it would not make a difference as the profits are split equally already. 

What do you guys think about the idea? Any criticism is welcome as I want to make sure that this is gonna work."	"2021-12-11 09:10:50"

He has been challenging them on every unfair rule and shady actions, and they have been very petty, toxic, and discriminative towards him for it for over half a decade.

Earlier this week, they had a big argument regarding salary and job description. They wanted him to create a “training manual” for all projects, but he refused because there’s too much that goes into it. They claimed his ideas and work technically “belongs to the company” so he offered to send them an invoice for it. Afterwards, he stormed off and HR boldly lied to us they were “letting him go despite his plead to stay.” It was an obvious load of bullshit because we all heard them yelling in the conference room. After over half a decade, it seems like HR won, but he still had one more card left. 

Before he left, he made a small announcement saying goodbye and added a small speech about never taking disrespect from absolutely anyone. Before he officially left for good, he asked us for one last request which most of us agreed to before even knowing what it was. 

He asked us some of us to share our wages since HR was VERY serious about keeping confidential. It wasn’t in any contracts or handbook so no one can get fired for it. A lot of us were reluctant at first, but eventually a few people shared. After the first 2-3 people, things started getting hectic. A lot of people were shocked to find out their coworkers were getting paid significantly more and wanted to know why. Thats when everybody found out that they were told completely different reasons why their wages were completely different. One person was told that their wage was lower because of their experience, while others revealed that they were told experience doesn’t matter. The whole company was in an uproar and pointing out obvious signs of sexism, discrimination, etc. When HR got back from lunch, they felt the wrath of the whole company. HR tried to turn it around on the employees who “violated” company policy, but instead of arguing with them, a lot of people just quit on the spot. I think about 10 people from different departments left immediately, 7 turned in their 2 weeks, and God knows how many others starting looking for new jobs. For the first time in my life, I'm actually excited to go to work early Monday morning to see how this unfolds. 

Moral of story: Fuck what HR said, talk about your wages and know your worth."	"2021-12-11 09:07:52"

"4797"	6	4	"So I've been working with a manufacturing company for a little over 2 years.  I do inside sales which is basicallyaterial quotes and customer service.  I had done some cooler stuff previously and so I made it clear when I started that while I was excited to join the company, it was really important to me to progress quickly in order to be happy and provide for my family...he always seemed like he was all good with that....always said he knows I am one his sharpest team members....great.
Fast forward 2 years and I've gotten 5 percent COL increase, and there is basically no info on how to secure something better for myself.  For context, our company is doubling up on our stretch goals. So the money is clearly there.  I've also volunteered to take over some really painful accounts and am honestly a good team contributor. He even says so.
In September I said ""I'm happy now, I won't be happy for long.  I finished my degree while working here with honors and I need to be making measurable progress. Recruiters call me on a weekly basis totally unsolicited and when the end of the year comes, I will be forced to take those calls more seriously in order to feel like I'm doing myself andy family justice.""
Him- ""yeah yeah yeah I got you I'm gonna talk to my boss and figure out how we do something to keep you and give you more opportunity to contribute as well as compensation.""
Months of silence. No forward momentum whatsoever.
So I took those calls. I ended up with an offer, terms of which I will find out this upcoming week.  By all accounts it would be way more money, and way more like what I want to do.
So now I'm in shock that I did the thing.
I went out, and with barely any effort, have secured a new position that has the potential to change my family's life and make me souch happier. 
...
I have to admit I am now terrified.  I like my boss but I can't see my current job getting me where I need to go.
My current company aren't bad people, as hard right as they are I do think the owner is passionate about keeping people employed, but if you aren't an engineer with 15 years in the field, I don't think it's something on which you can support yourself.
I just am afraid of making this massive decision, and I hate the idea of breaking the news to the people I like, even if I'm excited abouty prospect.

"4802"	0	5	"Hi, I haven't posted on here before, mostly I just lurk around this place. I can't say that I agree with everything in this sub, as there are some things that don't make sense to me, but this is what I think.

Employers have lost their minds. I'm not just talking about things with Kellogg's, but many companies in general. The shift of moving away from individual workers to expendable soldiers and automation makes no sense in any capitalistic world. The entire basis of an economy depends on the conditions of the worker and their own salary. In the short term it looks like an excellent idea to treat workers terribly, to ship factories to other countries, or even use robots... In the end it costs everything. If people can't purchase goods, if they can't live on what they make, the corporations will eventually suffer as well. If I can't afford as many goods, or if I lose my job to a robot, there is no chance of me supporting any corporation or local business, and the same can be said to a greater extent once everyone is out of work. No one will provide services that companies need, no one can afford to support these business financially, the production of goods would need to be significantly reduced. 

And why? Arrogance and pride. That saying ""no man is an island"", not in their minds. Just like a king cannot rule a kingdom with no people, a company cannot thrive without people working and consuming goods. People won't want to work for a crap salary, and even if I don't agree with every instance of that happening (since some people have dumb reasons for not working), employers set themselves up for this. Don't like the wages or getting shorted on every check? We can leave, and many of us have. I may not agree with certain things like raising the minimum wage or anything like that, but from where I stand there are several things that this group seems to get right. No one wants to live to be a corporate slave, pay taxes, and die. We want to live, we want places to belong, places to raise families if we want, and to not be stepped on.

Even if we disagree on everything else, at least we can all recognize that we were not created to be slaves to suffering. Thank you for reading"	"2021-12-11 08:35:16"

"4806"	3	5	"I got hired in October and it’s a Japanese Dollar Store... idk if I’m allowed to give out the name but I think anyone can do a search and see what it is... 

But... I got hired at $11/H. Seems easy enough. I stock things mostly or just cashiering people. Only difficult thing is the language barrier between a few customers since I’m in Chinatown USA. 

Anyways, as of this past month, the “higher ups,” or what I would call them... not the owner owner of the store or the mangers, but like the Japanese people from the company have been down for so long in our store.

I’ll cut to the chase. I’m the only white person that works there and the only person, surprisingly, who can speak and understand Japanese. The higher ups can, obviously, but nobody else and they know that. 

They talk with such confidence on the phone or to themselves. The last thing they’re thinking is the whitest person in the room listening in on their fully Japanese conversation. 

They’re raising our price up to $14/H in a few days because they think everyone will quit because it’s “so much work.” It’s extremely weird because it genuinely isn’t a lot of work.

I feel like I may just be saying that but I have been a really lazy person this year and the only thing that bothers me is the commute. I drive normally an hour each day, but now I’m having to drive over two hours.

I requested to be off from the 13th - Jan 1st because I’ll be home from college during that time and I love hours away from my store. I said I can absolutely not work, I said that as soon as I got hired and I mentioned it time after time. Even had it written down twice.

Yet, they put me on 25 hours (5/7 days this week.) like... they said they can’t change it now either. 

Like should I really make that commute 2 hours a day just for that? I mean it almost is double the average... Idk what other job would be so easy to get $14/h for basically keeping to yourself stocking or occasionally cashiering people. Besides buccees... but that place ALWAYS has people trying to get hired.

"4821"	21	2	"This happened a couple of months ago, but to be honest, I’m still processing it.

I started working as a photographer for an online consignment store back in spring of 2021. I’d spent months looking for full-time work and at that point was working two different part time jobs to make ends meet. This job caught my eye because not only was it full time, it also offered benefits, which would help me tremendously due to a chronic illness that costs me a lot of money each year in medical expenses. In addition to health insurance, I was promised bonuses any time we had a particularly successful day of sales.

When I landed the job, I was so excited that I overlooked a couple of red flags. The owner of the business kept lamenting that “nobody wants to work anymore” and how they’d lost most of their employees over the past few months.

Red flag #2 was that I was literally just dropped into the position with no training or instruction whatsoever. There was no employee handbook or paperwork aside from the tax stuff and direct deposit information. The previous photographer had left a huge mess of random photo equipment spread out everywhere and I had no time to organize it and very little time to even get used to everything. Nevertheless, I did my best, and the boss seemed happy with my work.

At the time I was hired, I happened to be dealing with a lot of problems related to my illness, and had doctor’s appointments every other week or so. I always let my boss know at least a week in advance, and I never missed a full day for these appointments, just an hour or two at most. At some point, though, my boss called a meeting to talk about how the employees were taking too many doctor’s appointments and that we should really try to arrange them to be on Monday, which was our day off. My doctor is also off on Mondays, so that would not be possible for me. I hadn’t disclosed my disability to my boss when I was first hired because I’m wary of being discriminated against, but at that point, I decided to tell him about it and he seemed to take it pretty well. He promised to not bother me about my appointments and to try and accommodate me however he could.

Over the next few months, things slowly got worse as it became clear to me that the two owners of the business did not know how to manage a business at all. There was very little communication between the two of them, to the point where one of them would tell the employees to do something and then the other would come and yell at us for doing the thing the other owner had asked us to do. They would frequently take days off, leaving the rest of us to scramble to try and figure out what was going on. Th receptionist, who was the sweetest person I have ever met, was a constant target for them to yell at and blame any time things went wrong. One week, the two owners went on vacation and told her not to accept any new consignments. We worked through every single thing in the building and got it listed for sale and photographed, finishing a couple of days before the owners were set to return, which left us with absolutely nothing to do. When they came back, they yelled at her for not arranging more consignment drop offs even though they had explicitly told her not to schedule any that week.

It also became clear that the company was having financial issues. The boss openly admitted that he’d had to take out a loan to make payroll, and this was about a month after he’d purchased himself a brand new Tesla.

Things were getting really bad, so I resolved to stay through Jan 1 and then put in my 2 weeks. New Year’s Day is the biggest sale of the year, and we were promised some very nice bonuses. I’m currently trying to move, so a good bonus could help me pay the fees and deposits for a new apartment.

Well, one day, I was at a doctor’s appointment and had to have my blood drawn. I hadn’t eaten anything that day and I got really faint and nauseous. I texted my boss telling him I’d be running a bit late because I wasn’t feeling well and he told me just to take the day off. I told him I felt fine to come into work, but he insisted.

The next morning when I came into work, I was called into his office. He told me he was disappointed in me, which instantly confused me as I tried to figure out what I had done. Apparently, I had taken too many days off. I’d taken a total of 7 days off in the span of 6 months. Four days for my birthday because my mom came to visit me from another state. I got this approved weeks in advance. One day to go see my grandfather during a time when he was struggling with depression after losing my grandmother. This was also approved far in advance. Then two days where I left early or called off the day of because I was feeling sick.

Anyways, he told me that because I’d taken too much time off, he was putting me on this “employee improvement plan” and that I would no longer be eligible for bonuses for a period of several months, which would extend past New Year’s. I was fuming mad. I pointed out that he was the one who had told me to stay home the previous day and if it was so much of an issue, he should have just let me come in. He made some lame excuse about trying to keep employees safe in case I had covid, but if he really thought I might have covid, he would have had me get tested before coming back to work.

I also pointed out that in my entire time working there I had never been informed about any sort of attendance policy. He said, word for word, “Well, we don’t have it in writing, but I know I’ve told you about it.”

I completely believe this is some new rule he pulled out of thin air because he didn’t feel like paying bonuses. I decided to put in my two weeks to give me enough time to look for another job, but before I could even tell the boss, I found out one of my favorite co workers had been fired. He had also happened to be sick the same day I was, so he got called into the office after me for the same speech. The boss, trying to act all nice, asked if there was anything he could do to make my coworker’s job easier, and the coworker mentioned that the other owner of the business often disrespected the employees. Well, the other owner didn’t like this much, and fired him on the spot. While my coworker was packing up his things, I went to my boss’s office and quit. Fuck two weeks notice. If he’s willing to fire a good employee over something so petty, I didn’t want to be there any longer.

I feel like a weight has been lifted from me now. I managed to find a new job doing the exact same thing with the same pay at a different place within three days of quitting. The new job has an actual employee handbook and clearly written rules. My new boss is a very kind and understanding person who has never once pressured me about doctor’s appointments or other obligations. I am so much happier.

Each time I think about what my old boss put me through, I get filled with rage. I wish I’d challenged him more during our meeting or gotten myself fired on purpose, but at that point, I just needed to get out and did what I had to do.

If anyone took the time to read through this massive post, I appreciate it! It felt really good to get this off my chest.

For those of you reading this, here’s my major takeaway. Always get policies in writing, because a boss will not hesitate to change the rules whenever it is convenient for them."	"2021-12-11 07:45:57"

I had been working in this team for almost 2 years. I consider myself a quick learner. I picked up the offered certificates (there were three levels). I made sure I got along with all the other departments and made good relations with the workers of said departments. I earned their respect, and that of my team.

Business was booming, and our department generated most of the profits of the company, so they opened more positions. We hired a couple more into our team, and I was responsible to train them. This made me feel pretty good, like I had a shot at the supervisor position. I worked my butt off, designed standards of procedures for jobs that needed them, and the existing ones were outdated, helped them out to learn the ropes and get to know the other departments we worked closely with, helped them study for the certs and get them up to speed.

Fast forward another year, one of our supervisors gets a better offer at one of the branches in another city. At first, I was on the fence about applying, that meant longer hours working and less hours studying for my career goals, but I needed the money, so I applied, but so does one of the new guys I trained. Interview comes and goes, and a month later they announce the new supervisor is the tech I trained. I was happy for me, legitimately happy for him. I was pissed at the Director of operations at snubbing me. I was ready to put in the hours -- I was already working 60+ hours at the job, staying late, helping with schedules, organizing big events, calling clients on their contracts and what not, I had more technical knowledge than the most senior at the department except my supervisor.

A Week passes by and it is clear he isn’t going to cut it as a supervisor. He never intended to help the team and just wanted to sit to “plan” processes when the plans are already laid out by our manager and the other senior supervisor. The team lost all respect for this guy and I was not going to let my time be affected by his incompetence. If it was time to clock out, I was out of the door and I spent all my time studying. The extra 20hours of OT I would instead put them in the books.

I got my certificate after 6 months I started applying everywhere! I will say that I was feeling depressed with all the jobs rejecting me. I finally applied to a job my friend sent me. I was severely under-qualified! He told me “What are they going to do? say no?"" Good point: I applied. After a week they called me in for my first interview (Wut?) I asked my Manager, the District IT manager, and my supervisor for letter of recommendation; they were happy to do them. I brushed up on my studies and went for the interview. I was honest with them in experience level, they seemed fine.
Another month goes by, and I was getting worried they had ghosted me. To my surprise they called me in for my second interview, this time it was with the panel of engineers to test my technical skills. I was sweating bullets during the interview but I did the configurations as they asked without problems, then they sent me on my way and they told me they would be contacting me.

Time went by and the new supervisor was bumped out of the team and placed in another department due to his incompetence. He was costing the department a lot of money in labor hours. I was very hesitant to apply again, but fuck I needed the money, and the other job wasn't in the bag yet. I applied, and so did the other new tech that I also trained! fuck me right? I once again prepared for my interview. 

I finally got a call back from the new job. They offered it to me. I legit cried in the staircase of my current job after I accepted the offer. It was a 100% pay increase from my current one. It was very hard for me to contain my excited. 

A couple of weeks go by and they send me the contract, I signed it. Now it was time to let my manager know. The following day my supervisor asks me if I was going to apply for the supervisor position again. I told him not this time, he told me "" I'm happy for you, now go a put in your two weeks’ notice, I know you got the job."" Thanked him and I went to my manager to let him know, he was also happy for me and gave me a big hug. 

[Post COVID19]
I do not take joy in this part of life. My job is extremely secure, and I was able to jump ship right on time. I am still in touch with my old supervisor and Manager, both of whom lost their jobs during COVID19. No fucks given by the company. Luckily they landed on their feet, they are very hard workers, unfortunately they were too rooted in the old habits of work ethics. 

Its rough out there, stay safe, look out for yourself! The best thing my former Director of operations told me was ""Be ruthless when asking for a raise,"" this was said to me after he rejected my request for a raise. I took it to heart, so I am numero uno, always will be, but I know my roots too and will always treat every position with respect that means that no one is deserving of these unlivable wages! I still am striving for better, this job isn't my end game.

I am an ICU nurse with multiple years of experience and multiple specialized certifications. I’ve worked at this particular hospital for 3+ years. When Covid hit, a few of us from each ICU (very large hospital, we have 6 ICU’s) staffed the first covid unit. I personally only had 4 days off in March 2020 and 5 days off in April 2020. 13+ hour shifts, double our normal patient work load, no PPE at times. I had a few coworkers become hospitalized with covid; a few died. But we worked our ass’ off because it was a once in a lifetime pandemic and patients needed us.

Fast forward to October 2021. Our covid numbers had finally stabilized, but I was not allowed to return to my original ICU where I worked for 1.5 years and got my specializations in because “that position has been filled since you left it voluntarily.”

The hospital cut RN pay in October due to “rising healthcare costs across the sector,” so now some ICU nurses are risking their lives at work for $23.50 an hour. Most of the remaining staff that hasn’t quit yet, quit after the announcement. Our unit needs 60 full time RN’s. At the time of the announced pay cut, they had 45, only 7 of which were actual employees. The rest were all contract. The contractors get paid $85 an hour. The staff gets paid base rate of $23.50 an hour. The staff is also responsible for being the charge nurse every shift because the contractors can’t. 

They cut pay so they couldn’t attract new contractors OR staff, so I was having to be the charge nurse every shift I worked, as well as take multiple critically ill patients myself. On top of that, our staff dropped so low, the last two months have consisted of me being the only staff member in the unit on most nights I worked. So now I’ve had to take on the role of charge nurse, take my own two critically ill patients as a staff nurse, and since i was the only staff member, i had to help everyone else learn the equipment, doctors, medicines, phone numbers, policies, as well as take every patient to CT/MRI that needed one, and make sure the unit was stocked with supplies.

I had to admit every single patient because no one else even knew where the ER was, let alone what we had to do to admit someone. Every equipment failure, every bag of blood we have to run down to get, every lab sample we had to run, I’ve been having to do it all. On top of that, two of my former coworkers now have permanent health issues from catching Covid at the hospital due to lack of adequate PPE. I have been struggling with PTSD from the first wave of Covid, when I lost over 20 of my own patients in a month.

I asked for a raise from $26/hr (my current rate) to $30/hr. I was the only full time staff member left besides the two supervisors.

I was denied and told “nurses can’t make that much.” 

I should also mention my manager actively told us not to submit safety violations because it created “too much paperwork for me.” 

After a week of negotiations, I quit. I’ve never been happier with my decision."	"2021-12-11 07:38:27"

I work in Marketing, 6+ years of experience in a very niche field. Worked for the same large company for most of that time. I have a reputation amongst colleagues as a hard working, innovative, resourceful, team player who always excels, yet I was significantly underpaid for years. Really I was miserable but afraid to leave because imposter syndrome.

However, I was doing so well that last year I was given the chance to join a program within the company, that took me away from my regular job for a few weeks to learn new skills, and make additional contributions. If I did well enough, I was told there could be a permanent spot for me on this team. While I was there, there were some organizational changes on my old team that left a possibility for me to lead them and earn significantly more money. Throughout this time I was in communication with my old VP who said that she thought I would be a good match, going as far as formally interviewing me 3 weeks before the temporary project was due to be over.

Once this project was over, I was told they were impressed with me and given the choice to stay on the team or go back. I spoke to my old VP who said it was up to me but that she really wanted me to return and ""lead the charge"". So, since I enjoyed my old job much more and saw more job security there, I returned to my old team...

You guessed it, after a few weeks I was told there would be no promotion. She instead hired her friend.

Two months later, I was offered a job somewhere else making 30% more salary plus bonuses. I went to my VP and said ""if you will match it, or come close, I'll stay"" (that was dumb of me, I know). She said ""I can offer you 5% and I'm not even sure of that. I don't like counter offers."" So I left, and within a few weeks so did everyone else that was on that team.

She did me a favor. Within 6 months, I have almost tripled my salary (switched jobs a second time), make even more in bonuses and work less hours with very little stress. Plus, my new company and bosses are amazing. 

Suck it old VP!

I am moving out of state and didn't feel the need to give a 2 week's notice since I'm an At-Will employee and owe no one an explanation for my life decisions.

I also trust in businesses to ""figure it out"" in my absence, as it is their job to hire and fire people, not force them to stay.

Additional to moving soon, I just didn't want to be there anymore. And knew I could make money other ways.

It was frustrating. Sometimes I was drowning in work to the point that I needed back up and got none. Other days there were too many people trying to do my job and we were practically fighting over things to do. The workload was either too much or too little, and you were either not relieved for a break on fast days, or the boss would try and micromanage you when even they had nothing to do because the workload was too small. On days like that, you were just supposed to ""look like"" you had a lot to do to avoid being micromanaged. And sometimes, if the managers didn't wanna do something, you'd have to go out of your zone and do fun little side projects like, ""lifting stuff way beyond my wight limit"", ""cleaning out ovens while they are on"" or ""other dangerous activities"". Fun stuff!

I pretty much didn't want that stuff to happen to me anymore. I'd already seen enough injuries to know I wasn't even safe on a slow day.

And why was it slow, you ask? Because so many people quit and we had to close breakfast and lunch.

The next day, I COULD NOT go in. I mentally could not. And that's how I knew it was my last day. I didn't want to quit over text because I pride myself on being somewhat professional, so I did the next best thing. I wrote up a letter and attached it to my text (well, I had to take a screenshot of it because it didn't work, but the effort was there) and I turned it in an hour-30 mins before my shift, blocked all my bosses immediately, and never heard from anyone again, because I literally didn't want or need to. Yes, I ghosted them.

They never saw it comin'.

And it's not that I wanted to hurt them intentionally, but sometimes you gotta do what's best for you and gtfo NOW, without begging for forgiveness or getting scorned after the fact.

I feel so much better mentally and physically since leaving. Doing gig work now (which I set up before quitting), spending so much time with my Hubs, and finally getting to prepare for the holidays and my big move!

I work as an in plant engineer for a major automotive supplier.  Up until a few years ago we had a forging engineering manager and a machining engineering manager.  A few years ago the powers that be brought in a new guy to replace them both.  I have no major issues with him.  He’s young yes, has minimal practical experience yes, had no experience managing a team, yes.  Regardless off all that he has really come a long way and I support him as my boss.  It took a few years to figure out how to be a manager because you can’t learn that in school but he figured it out.  And even with his lack of practical experience he doesn’t pretend to be smarter than everyone and knows that his strength lies in his team’s knowledge and skills.  I really do like him.  

Back to my coworkers.  We recently lost a large product line and as a result our sales didn’t justify the size and salaries of the entire engineering team. The companies solution was to let go both the prior managers (who had 40+ and 20+ years with the company respectively). I’m pretty sure this was purely a financial decision and nothing else.  I would guess that these two were making at least double what anyone else in engineering was. They lost their manager titles but didn’t take pay cuts.  My problem with the situation was the fact that we lost some really vital knowledge and skills.  The prior forging engineering manager was more vital than anyone else in our department. Even after the demotion he was still the one doing all the actual work.  He had two guys under him and one was basically a glorified maintenance guy.  The other one is a good engineer but never actually got to learn what he needed to know.  Now we have one forging engineer that will have to bust his ass and probably fuck up a lot of shit in the process to keep up with the work.  

The other prior manager who ran my side (machining) was one of the smartest guys I’ve ever met.  He wasn’t as vital as the forging guy as we have a larger and well qualified team but still he was the guy we all went to that could solve any problem.  When he was demoted the new boss basically relegated him to bitch work.  He was doing the kind of shit we usually make our interns do.  It’s sucks that he’s gone but it won’t hurt us as much as losing our lead forging engineer. 

Point of the story is how frustrating it is to see decisions based solely on a short term financial basis.  We lost the two highest paid engineers we had because that’s how we could cut the most costs with the smallest affect on man hours.  Losing our lead forging engineer is going to fuck us.  Maybe not right away but I guarantee a year from now losing him will cost more than they saved. Losing our lead machining engineer hurts but I’ll be honest and admit he kinda checked out after getting demoted.  Now issues are going to come up and we are going to waste money and time reaching for outside help. 

What pisses me off the most is the fact that I could easily identify half a dozen people on salary staff who are completely useless and don’t deserve the job or wages they get.  We have a QE (quality engineer) that corporate loves because she recently got her phd.  She makes more than all of us and is completely useless.  She is Korean (I think, not racist just don’t care) and can’t speak English to save her life despite the fact that she has lived in the States since childhood.  (On a strange side note I had a coworker who briefly dated her and claims she speaks perfect English outside of work). For example, I have a habit of immediately deleting any emails I receive from her because they are either completely unintelligible or just stupid and wrong.  I have even admitted this to my boss and he completely agrees with me ignoring her.

A Youtuber, named TotallyNotMark, who reviews anime and manga, was copyright claimed by videos that fell under Fair Use, resulting in the blocking of over [150 videos](https://youtu.be/WaeqXWzaizY).

Toei is infamous for blocking Fair Use content left and right, and, just because they have money, they have gotten away with it for too long. YouTube has also been awfully unhelpful dealing with this situation. This is nothing out of the ordinary for both companies, but doing it on this scale, leaving Mark's small company without any money, especially on Christmas.

By no means am I saying we should donate, but we should stop supporting Toei's future works (DBS movie coming out next year) and all their content coming from Japan. It's fucked. I love DBZ as much as the next guy, but this is not the first time this happens, and it's getting out of hand.

Mark posted an update regarding how futile YouTube has been, and how they suggest to get a channel manager that he has to pay for, but he can't get that, either. It's so fucked when big corporations can do anything without repercussions. [See here.](https://youtu.be/WAuWk8POxSQ)

[Soldiers of Pole](https://soldiersofpole.com/about/)

I don’t think there is enough of a push to support sex workers/strippers, so here’s a snippet of why non swers should care more:

My partner of several years has been employed as a stripper for 9 months now, and it’s incredibly frustrating what she’s had to deal with.

First of all, her employment is considered “independent contractor”- which is not entirely legal and a way for club owners to avoid providing any sort of benefits.

So, her full time job has NO benefits. Recently she suffered a tissue infection in her right knee, putting her out of work for 2 weeks. Not only does she have no support from her workplace, the injury was probably related to the fact that cleaning/small maintenance of  the stage is left for the girls to do. She has never seen anyone except fellow dancers actually clean the stage.

Also, some clubs will fire you for not showing up every week regardless of your situation, such as an injury. Some will also fire you for working at more than one club. She has had friends be blacklisted for breaking this rule. 

Owners/managers pull a lot of other bullshit. They can take your tips, a chunk of your dances sold, and set house fees where you pay to be able to show up to work basically. She has seen a manager snatch away a dancers purse because she couldn’t meet the house fee. 

Another reason union organization would be beneficial is that it can get very competitive and cutthroat among girls working in the same club. The environment does little to encourage solidarity. 

So many fucked up things go on in this line of work. My partner has so many stories I’ve probably forgotten most of them already. 

My partner loves to dance. Being on the pole is so empowering for her, it’s her outlet. But because of a simple injury, she’s dipping into the last of her savings to pay rent. It is entirely unfair to strippers and sex workers to have to live month to month- or even week to week- on uncertain wages.

I am a 16 year-old working in a fast-food burger joint. I’ve been working there for almost a year and a half, and have learned all the positions both in the front and back of house. Right now I am a crew trainer: our management structure goes crew member -> crew trainer -> shift leader (manager in training) -> manager. I’ve been working several 30 hour school weeks, and have had to cancel social events just so I can stay at my job. However, last week, three new people were promoted straight from crew member to shift leader. One of them actually deserves it, as they have been working there for several years. I’m frustrated at the other 2. One started 4 MONTHS AGO, and the other 2 MONTHS AGO. I don’t know what it is, but I’m just frustrated that my work keeps on getting ignored in favor of those who just started. For the kind of mental stress I get put under, I only make 10 fucking dollars an hour. For all the sleep-deprived school days and missing social events."	"2021-12-11 06:11:04"
"4875"	5	12	"I've worked in the ticketing industry for almost two decades (event ticket, movie ticketing, etc) and one model that is frequently used is the Pay-What-You-Will model where you offer your patrons a sliding scale price to pay for the event. There is no hierarchy in terms of value, every patrons gets the same chance at the same seats, but it creates an accessible environment where more people are able to access the thing. And, from a business sense, we'd rather have the $5 than $0 if they can't pay $10.

If you flip this over, and apply it to hiring, a company could really gain some clout right now if they employed a Get-Paid-What-You-Will model, where upon interviewing, the applicant explains how much salary they feel they need to live a comfortable life, free from financial stress. And then that is the salary they get.

At first glance, the instinct here is to assume almost everyone will ask for so much salary that there's no way a business could withstand it, but if it played out like Pay-What-You-Will ticket pricing has over the years, the vast majority of people would come up with a wage that was fair.

Then, each year at raise time, the employee gets to choose their new rate based on their own performance. Again, you'd be surprised at the modesty of the amounts of these self-raises.

This is of course based on anecdotal observation and reporting from one perspective, but it's certainly true that giving autonomy to people to value their own self worth both allows them to feel like they are being treated fairly and helps breed a culture of trust between an employer and employee.

Lastly, let me say that I, myself, am classically anti-work and believe in a future where we don't have to slave away every day just to meet our basic needs, but there are plenty of people who WANT to work, and innovative ideas in hiring and managing are needed to help support them."

I live with my parents and they said they'd never kick me out or make me pay rent. I have no driver's license. I hardly pay for anything and live a middle class lifestyle. I'm also not looking to date. I've been pressured by multiple people to apply for SSI, but don't want to even try to enter into that hellhole. DOR has been useless.

I go back and forth on how I feel about mooching off my parents with no end in sight. On one hand, I feel like a worthless, unaccomplished piece of shit who so far hasn't amounted to what people anticipated I would and like I live in a void with no intellectual outlet, but on the other, I feel grateful to have such a supportive family that I largely get along with, and don't like any of the traditional options which have been advertised to me so far.

I've known for a while that I don't like the idea of having a boss or being massively indebted to some investor like a record label in the long run and having to constantly be in service of other people's dreams and ideas. I also have never worked super well with other people and am not sure what my stamina would be for a 40+ hour work week given how poorly I sometimes handle stress.

The most attractive-sounding thing to me at the moment is to have my own business which revolves around my own skills and interests, but I'm scared that in order to do really well, that I'd have to be super predatory and ruthlessly step on everybody in order to come out on top.

First off the hiring process is complete bullshit. I applied for the position that would let me drive the forklift and other equipment, but instead was made to do the grueling job of sorting and stowing packages. Having to do a job that you weren't applying for seems like commonplace, so one should expect this sort of thing, however my dumb self really wanted to drive a forklift. That and the fact that the pay I was told I would get for the applied position was $17 and some change. 

Now onto my shift type, flexrt. Advertised as you choose your hours is bullshit. Shifts are split into 4 sections of a day. 2 morning/afternoon shifts and 2 night/overnight shifts. As a part time worker (again I applied for a full time shift) I have a 30 hour minimum requirement for each week. At this point in time I have settled to work every morning from 7:30 to 12:15. A short shift that best helps my physical and mental health. The issue I have run into with this is the fact that 98% I do not get this schedule. The concept of ""choose when you work"" is more ""first come first serve"" where the shifts are taken faster than the newest gen console by scalper bots. And it's even more dumb with the number of flexrt workers in my section of the building is below 10. It's gotten to the point that even when I have the app open and refreshed at 6:00pm, the time new schedules come up each Friday, I'm very limited with my options from Monday being nonexistent, stuck working overnight shifts, which I have trouble working due to the stress of waiting for the time to go to work where I can't get anything done out of fear of getting too into the task and missing work entirely. (Not sure if it's and autism or anxiety thing specifically)

I've almost lost my job for getting a flat tire and not being able to make it to work, but you have no one to talk to explain you aren't able to come in. I've also had to give myself an infraction and run risk of being fired due to leaving early because I wasn't physically capable of working anymore. Went to amcare, my manager, and then hr and no one could do shit that could let me go home without issue. That and peak season means no vacation or leave of absence. 

I'm just at a loss rn. I honestly want to leave my job, it's unhealthy physically and mentally, I have no idea if anything can be done, and I'm just frustrated. I have worked at this location longer than a good majority of other workers yet I am still treated poorly. I feel trapped in this job due to how hard it is to find a new job. Anyone have any advice?"

So, I work for an airline handling company out of TPA. Basically, we are contractors for airlines who do ticketing, boarding, etc. in the airline uniform, but since we are contractors, we have lower pay and no airline benefits. This evening, my supervisor texted a groupchat of the employees that the client, the airline, is requesting that the employees go to Orlando to continue training and shadowing the contractors for the airline that has already resumed service at MCO, tomorrow, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, all in formal business attire that many of us do not even have (with the expectation that we have to pay for the suits, ties, etc.).

Here’s the kicker: when one of the employees texted the groupchat about their concerns about the cost of driving from TPA to MCO, like tolls, gas, parking etc., the supervisor said that we will have to absorb those costs ourselves and that we are “paid to work, not to travel.” When the employee responded by saying, imo rightfully, “we should be reimbursed for for current IRS mileage rates to cover miles and gas” for the round trip, the supervisor said, “you all chose this job and if you don’t like it I will accept your resignation. This training is not up for debate.” 


I plan on meeting with the station manager (the supervisor’s boss) tomorrow to discuss this and other incidents with this manager and I wanted to know how I should discuss this with them. Is what the supervisor is demanding even legal?

Each branch is a separate entity and they constantly close and reopen under different names to avoid legal action and bad press. I lasted a month until I found this amazing website.

DS-MAX, Smart Circle, Cydcor, Innovage, Granton, Quantum, The Landers Group, Cobra Group, PerDM, Credico, Appco Group, Optimo International, Socio Max, etc., are the exact same company.  They all have the same system, run the same scam, and are owned by the same people.  They all have a “management training program”, incorporate their managers in order to avoid lawsuits, post misleading advertisements on career websites, and lie and cheat like it’s going out of style.  Having all these names is the only way to keep their racket alive because it makes it harder for people to find out who they’re working for. 

Just think about it.  Why do they have so many names?  If they were doing good deeds, they wouldn’t need to hide within their nested spheres of deception and duplicity.  If they were doing the right thing, they would gather their entire organization under one banner and proudly advertise themselves to the world.  Instead, they change names like people change underwear and continue their fraud with different identities so new employees don’t know who they’re working for. 


TOP TEN SIGNS YOU ARE WORKING FOR DEVIL CORP
#10 You’ve been employed by your company for four months and it’s changed its name more than once.

#9 You tell relatives and acquaintances you’re working on an “advertising campaign” but you’re really selling products door-to-door, inside of major retailers, collecting for charity, or hustling junk in a box on street corners.

#8 You have to go to the office every morning and participate in cult-like rituals meant to brainwash you on their business. You work twelve hours a day, six days a week and spend all your free time with co-workers.

#7 Your management training involves you buying lunch for new recruits.  You realize you’re not a manager nor are you participating in any management training.  You believe you’re only “in the field” in order to get your own office.

#6 You look down on “9-5 schmucks” who have secretaries that make more than you and your entire team combined.

#5 You espouse the principles and theories of the most successful people on earth who would absolutely be repulsed by the business you’re in. 

#4 You work 70+ hours a week but quietly borrow money from your sixteen year old neighbor who works at McDonald’s.  

#3 You eat fast food more than ten times a week or can’t afford to eat out at all.

#2 You live in a two bedroom apartment with 6 co-workers and one of them is your boss.

#1 You work for an organization that has in just three decades screwed more than a million people while only the select few at the top of the pyramid have actually made any real money. 

If you can say yes to any of these signs, you should probably run."	"2021-12-11 05:30:59"
"4912"	20	6	"I recently lost my job. I was paying $80 dollars biweekly for insurance and $75 dollar copay for an office visit to my cardiologist. Had to go every 6 months. Check the healthcare.gov to look for options after I lost my job to get my meds refilled. Cheapest option for me was $290 a month with a $8900 deductible before they would even cover half the cost for me to see a specialist. I scrolled through a lot of the options until I found one that would cover even a fraction of the cost for me to see my regular doctor, most would not even pay for my existing care giver. The cost was well over $400 dollars to even sign up plus what and office visit would cost. I am out of work so that would really cause me some problems. I was like ""fuck it"", then I called my doctors office to see how much it would cost me to just pay it myself. They originally said $330 dollars unless they want to do an EKG, and if not we can reimburse you for the EKG cost. That option was a lot cheaper then paying for insurance while unemployed. It actually seemed cheap so I told her again I was paying myself without insurance. She said I might qualify for a discount. She said I did. Private pay is $190 with an EKG if they don't give me and EKG they will refund me the cost of and EKG after I pay. So I was a bit confused so I asked if the $190 was along with the $330. She said $190 was the personal pay discount with an EKG, if they didn't do an EKG I would be refunded $35. So without my insurance through my job I will pay $380/$345 a year to see my cardiologist, with my insurance it was $2070. US health care is way broker then I could have imagined."

Ok, let's stop with the job-hopping debate.

If you're switching jobs because you are:
❌underpaid
❌bored
❌disrespected
❌overworked
❌unappreciated
❌want better for yourself

That is not job-hopping. That's called not settling.

( I really don't like the term job-hopping, I think it's gaslighting but that's another post I'll make.)

If you know what you want & refuse to sacrifice your expectations just to say you have a job, hop away friend. 

The only way ""job-hopping"" can backfire is if you have no clarity on what you're looking for & crossing your fingers hoping to find what you want. 

I think you need to be strategic & intentional.

BUT if you have a plan & know what you are trying to obtain it can work out in your favor. 

Over are the days of rotting away in a job you hate. 

Over are the days of using ""gratefulness"" to cover up your misery.

I guess we will all be some rabbits 🐰🐰😂because I am hopping away from anything that doesn't serve me. 

You deserve better. Stop apologizing for it.

This happened during quarantine. I got my first job in the tech industry with a promise of going full-time after my contract was over. The contract pretty much stated I'd be working as a w-2 under the contracting company for 6 months and after the 6 months, I'd be evaluated based off my work performance and be hired full-time should I do well. I'd spoken to my co-workers who were full-time and they stated that's how they were hired on as full-time with benefits. cue covid happening and the company to place a hiring freeze. My contract changed to month to month, and once this occurred I decided to start applying to other positions. 

The day came when my manager hit us up saying they would not renew our contract but he'd help us out with our resume's and give a letter of recommendation to all of us contractors. After being laid off, I found another job, and this is the job in question that forced us to turn on our cameras.

Little to my knowledge, this company was an MSP(basically outsourced help desk). I didn't know this at the time of hire that I'd have to take calls and assist user's troubleshoot their issue. This was a lower tier position below my skill set. In my first week, meeting with my manager, he'd stated our camera's had to be on, and I hated this, but i complied because i needed the job. The same week, I had started my new position was the same week i started looking for work else where.

Fast forward a month later, and I'm hired at my dream job(i know.. i know.. there is no such thing as a dream job, but if i have to work, might as well have a favorable one, right?).  This was the exact position I was looking for at a pretty good company in my favorite industry. We had a team meeting at the MSP job, and a couple of us had our camera's off. My manager gets pissy and says ""if you don't have your camera's on, it's a write up and eventual termination. If you don't like it, feel free to leave"". Me knowing I already had secured the other position with an offer letter and such, I respond with ""okay. Consider this my two weeks notice"". 

If you guys had seen the face he made oh my dear lord lmfaoo. He just responded with ""well wait, lets talk about this after this meeting in private"".  yeah, what ever he said didn't get me to change my mind. I'm still here at my new position and I'm honestly loving it. I get to learn new things every day from people much smarter than me, and it's exactly what I'd want to do if I had to work.

I worked at a beach summer camp/marine science education camp that was run out of a small building (this was before the virus).  It was a very small company and I've worked previously for various camp positions all the way up to director for about 12-15 years or so.  For this camp I acted as an on-site director as well as multi-media manager/producer and had started the october before the virus in the U.S.  

Then the virus came and we shut down for a couple of weeks as we assessed the situation.  This is when things started to go... Crazy.  We lost the office so the business moved into boss's home and we converted it.  We opened arguably way too soon with not nearly enough covid-safety protocols.  We even had a family she let through who ALL had it and then didn't tell us.  I found out from a coworker working that specific camp WAY later and was never told by the boss.

 She would call us and tell us sometimes the morning of a camp that we had to go to work without checking out availability (camps were not overnight and just based out of different beaches).  Some paychecks were not getting to us and I was being paid 12 an hour.  My only job.  And I might've been the highest paid person there.  She would get upset if we disclosed money info with the coworkers.  But none of it was a big deal cause I love childcare and was in it for the kids and a nice easy beach job that I was good at.  Getting kids to have fun while being safe.  (Which I might add was never good enough for her if we missed a tiny thing to do that day from her 'list' which was more concerned about knowing what we were doing every second and where all the equipment was.  Since we were understaffed severely I had to keep track of everything, watch the kids and staff, plan the day, teach any lessons, watch safety, and I drove the equipment to and from location, dealt with parents, did attendance and more IN ADDITION to my media job. ) 

To clarify as well at this point we were a skeleton crew at every location.  3 people (2 adults) to take care of up to 20 kids (not too hard normally) but at a beach.  An adult always had to be present, we also had to be in the water watching ALL of them and making sure they didn't disappear.  All while I had so many other duties.  And we still didn't go one day without some complaint from either overprotective parents who stayed to watch (seriously why send your kids to a camp).  Or from my boss who would be mad over tiny things like doing a game differently or skipping a lesson for a different one the kids would want to hear.  She was VERY micromanaging.

And then the shjt storm hit.  One morning I had fallen a bit ill from food poisoning.  So she had me still go and take attendance for the camp that morning and let me go home.  However instead of sending someone or having herself cover for me as a director... Y'know having a good adult there... She left the watch and care of the kids to my counselor and junior counselor.  They then proceeded to be FIRED when they took the kids off camp grounds to go pick up some food and go watch a movie at the junior counselor's house.  Just the WORST idea.  They were caught when the JC's parents got an alert from their door camera.  

Bad idea and I felt a bit bad since I couldn't be there to have stopped that.  BUT the reason I quit came up because of this.  The counselor was upset at my boss and started telling her that we complained all the time about her and the money and the details of the job.  The counselor basically told her all the issues we had with her... Except I was still working for her.  So I get into the office the next day and learn all this, and it sends me into shock by her yelling at me for a while, then she says she wants to see all the messages we had been sending.  I was an idiot and in shock over finding out and handed my phone to her.  (Now mind you there was nothing illegal on there at all.  The only things she wouldn't have liked were us discussing pay and complaining about how uptight the environment was but also lax COVID safety rules and minor complaints about what had happened.  Y'know, talking shop.

She proceeds to fire two more people on the spot.  I feel horrible because I basically got them fired and I should've just held on to my phone and got fired myself.  She tells me 'im on thin ice and lucky she needs the help' and sends me home.  

I immediately started looking for a new job and one month later I quit.  I know there could've been some legal actions I might've looked into but the place was a nightmare I'm glad to be distanced from.  Also there's no good documentation of the bad stuff.  

As far as I know the business went under (no money which she never told us in time anyways) and everyone I know lost their job there.  Then she resurfaced and is still doing the job.  But I'm staying far away.  I spent over a decade of my life being a very successful child care professional and how she runs her business is just ... Wrong. 

I wish I had a tldr for this but it's just too much to summarize. 

 Anyways I'll field any questions or clarifications I can cause I know I must've missed or not explained correctly."	"2021-12-11 05:14:29"

"4923"	16	6	"So a coworker and I work at a very large manufacturing company as a training specialist. We get paid 60k a year. I did logistics she did assembly.  We also do on boarding and job placement. She request a raise they said no, so she left. now they hired one person for 60k to do onboarding and just posted a job for 80k just for the training assembly portion.

I then go to my boss and tell them I should receive this much since I still do both and now y’all split up the last job into two positions. My boss counters with some bs promotion in place and 3 grand raise and then maybe the amount of money the new assembly training position is. After taxes and insurance..that’s is under 50 dollars extra a month. 

They could have just gave my coworker ten grand hell twenty grand raise and she would have stayed but no and now they are paying two people or if you will….paying 140k to do the job that they were paying someone just to do for 60k. It’s insane they pushed out a good employee and they did it again.  

They couldn’t justify why all of a sudden half the amount of work is consider such a high paying job. But mine is still the same.

The whole thing is another company offered me 80k yearly with it provided as needed….100k in stock. I was going to turn that down Bc I thought my job cared about me.

"4931"	16	10	"Alright guys, get ready. Today was day 3 of my new career with a very well known and highly desirable company to work for. Day 1 and 2 are my normal benefits briefings, hr paperwork etc. I was doing orientation with other new hires as well, however majority of the briefings didn't apply to me because of my position(alittle higher up and classified in nature) so alot of my questions were not able to be answered. 
Day 3, I meet my supervisor at 645am. A simple shake of the hand and exchange of greetings. 
12pm I ask a coworker to show me to the supervisors office to discuss a schedule issue. The schedule in my contract doesn't match what I'm being told I am working. 
I mean vastly different. I bring this to said supervisor of whom I met 4 hours ago for 2 minutes.
 He proceeds to tell me I don't have time for this today! I'm wrong, he interviewed me and he doesn't make mistakes. We exchange a few more comments, all peaceful. I proceeded to hr to figure out the schedule issue because he seemed very incompetent and the furthest thing from credible information. Hr takes a copy of my contract fwds it to employee relations. 
I then proceed back to the supervisor to show him the contract in writing. I hand it to him and he states what the f*** is this supposed to mean to me? Along with a few more jabs. I then told him him how disrespectful and unprofessional he is all while he laughs at me and mutters the same thing back as if he's surprised someone finally told him.. I attempted to retrieve my contract from him which he tried to take from me and keep it from me after I told him hr has been notified regarding the shift issue. I suspect because this is the only proof I had of anything, I walked away and this gentleman followed me more then 1000 feet harassing me on camera about contacting hr. We exchanged more pleasantries in the stairwell where he proceeded to ""fire me"" and take my badge.

5 hours later, after contacting hr, security camera footage is being pulled and I am being paid without going to work till the conclusion of the investigation. Hr stated, supervisors do not have firing authority, and he broke numerous security protocols. 
They also referenced discrimination.

Any advice? They genuinely seem very worried I'm going to take this further. Corporate hr called me after hours, to state I am an employee. I am being paid. I am not expected to go to work, my time card will be filled out and asked I be patient while this is handled. I told them I am speaking to the eeoc  and an attorney seeking options, but only seeking at the moment and how I handle this is dictated by how they do.

It seems to me that if AI perform as we believe them to be capable of, that at this very moment, we are writing the data and story that will form some of the basis for it's intelligence and behavior, when one inevitably gets loosed on the internet.

It seems like this is a battle of titans unfolding before me, gestalt beings of light flitting this way and that as they integrate with each other, waves of color spreading through limbs and nodes as different ideologies literally struggle it out.

I do installs at a SaaS firm. Software is garbage and for 2 years I was the only one who could figure out enough work arounds for successful go-lives. Once this was apparent, I was pulled in every direction to put out every fire. Didn't mind, I enjoyed the work. But why am I getting paid the same as the others in my position who's messes I'm constantly cleaning? 
 
So I'm promised a promotion with a decent bump from 50 to 65k and a middle management title, was all I wanted and easily deserved. They say we're working on it, we're waiting on these numbers, we need to move things around, blah blah...I see it's just going no where. So I start interviewing. I make it known that I am, they can't fire me or they'll have no launches. Then all the sudden guess what! It's approved! Great. I tell my interviewers to kick rocks, I never really wanted to leave the job I was so damn good at. 
 
Surprise surprise, back to the red tape and excuses. Now I'm pissed, I've could have had that salary by now with one of those jobs, so I go back to interviewing. Within a few weeks I'm hired at another SaaS firm, at that 65k mark. Awesome, nothing more rewarding then turning in a resignation letter at a place that's wronged you.
 
Interesting part here - less than 24 fucking hours from the point I turned that in, I had a written offer on my fuckin desk, for $15k more than what I asked. Are you fucking kidding me, all this bullshit about red tape and you could have had it done within a fucking day. Keep your fucking money, I'm broke but I have some pride. I was so offended by that and made that clear. Should have just said thanks and goodbye, would have been much better terms. 
 
Anyway, fast forward a few months and I'm damn miserable at the new job. It's healthcare related, and what a complete fucking nightmare. There is a reason that shit is so expensive and anyone in that biz can attest to the fucking pork. Won't go too far into that, but the director at my old job quit, so they reached out to me to fill the spot, even higher salary doing exactly what I was doing before. They screwed me but it saved me from the healthcare job. 
 
So now I'm back, and I'm technically the bad guy with this sub (mid-management). BUT to my credit I've never denied PTO (cause that's fucked) and when they need the time and had training/customer obligations, I handle it for them, because that's my role.   
 
They have pissed me off once since I've been back. C-Level pulled me aside to thank me for coming back. I explained how insulted I was with the circumstances of me leaving. She said the offer was going to come that week either way and it was just ""bad timing"". That was a lie, and an obvious one. I just said ""okay"", and left. Raised all those feelings again. But I'm fine now, like my job and love my team.

She was laid off in 0ctober 2020 ""due to COVID setbacks at her company."" I put that in quotes because, well, we don't believe them. She spent about 6 or 8 months looking for a good fit and collecting unemployment and stimulus benefits, as we were fine as I also have a good job (engineer). Finally she started to feel like she just needed a job so she took a job she doesn't care about and is unlikely to advance her career in any way. The pay is good, slightly less than her previous job, but more than I make and more than mostly of our friends and family make. 

However, within a few weeks here she decided wow, this job is trash. So for the last several months she has been doing the bare minimum, meetings etc for her job while spending the majority of her weekday hours interviewing for other jobs that actually suit her resume and that will pay her what she's worth (she's got almost 15 years in her very specialized industry, she's rare and worth a lot). She's had several final interviews for >6 figure jobs and I'm confident she will land one, but I'm just so stoked that she's been able to basically blow this job off because the company sucks and they're under paying her for her time. 

I'll also add that earlier this summer, she accepted a role at another company, and after they mailed her her laptop and other supplies, she sent them back and declined the job because she ""just wasn't into it.""

I was already working full time (45hrs/week) at this job but still couldn't afford to live off of that, so this promotion meant I was able to stop doing gigs and start having a life outside of work. A month after I quit doing gigs, my hours were decreased to 30hrs/week (so now I make the same as I made before my promotion), we have also lost our health benefits in this time (the owner forgot to renew our plan and just hasn't gotten to doing it), and I was of course given more responsibilites due to my promotion, with significantly less time to do it...all l while working a windowfront shop in the downtown core of my city.

I have about 1-2hrs each day where I don't have anyone else in the store with me. I now spend that time applying for other work. I've also since told the co-workers I get along with that I'll be gone as soon as I can find a new job so they know what's up if offered my position after I leave. Take this as your reminder that owners will do anything in their power to save money and their promises are empty as fuck.

I hope this type of post is allowed in the sub, usually I see people posting semi-hopeful messages but yeah...fuck not being able to afford life because your employer wants to save a dime"	"2021-12-11 04:35:41"

It’s been in TV shows, movies, books and, of course, word of mouth for the last few generations at least. People want to know you suffered. If you didn’t you are to pay the price on the other end. 

You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth. You were treated better because of your looks or you’re a kiss ass. There is simply no way forward, for many people, without running the gauntlet of abuse. 

Those posting stories here and supporting those who have to deal with the assholes of most work environments are attempting to change the status quo. We went to be treated fairly and humanely whether we started today or have been there for 40 years. We want no one taken advantage of and everyone to receive a livable wage. Yet much of the push back isn’t bosses, it’s other workers who didn’t fight back and want you to suffer as they did. 

They are simply jealous of you for standing up for yourself when they didn’t. Don’t stop doing what is right. Especially in the face of jealous people who wish they had the guts you did."	"2021-12-11 04:34:39"

Obligatory: on mobile.. pls excuse mistakes

For a while I was working as an adjunct lecturer. FYI…We are the low paid college professors that fill in the class listings and don’t have benefits such as health insurance. 

Anyway, I had children and eventually stopped signing up to teach classes to spend time with my kids. Mind you, I’m still on payroll and could re-sign up at any point because I was in good standing with student reviews & teacher observations, etc… 

I lost track of my teacher email login because they keep making you change passwords, so often I just gave up on it.  That’s where they normally reach out to me. 

They must have been desperate because I get this email some weeks ago to my personal email asking if I could teach such and such classes, and I thought about it, and figured why not? They need help and I could use the money. I could stress myself just for the one semester as a favor to them and kind of keep active in my field. 

A week after I accepted to fill the classes, I get an email that I need to interview for it. What the?! 

I figure it’s just like a meeting to meet the new dean who took over from the last time. 

I was wrong.

So after accepting the interview and 2 days before it would take place, the dean says I must prepare a lesson on a topic he specified using PowerPoint that lasts at least 15 minutes. 

I freaked out on the inside and still accepted it, but then after about an hour of freaking out about finding time on the fly (without pay), I wrote back that I was no longer available to teach.

She literally steam rolls over our projects and duties which is absolutely maddening. By the way, did I mention she is a project manager...? The worst type of ""career"" that was ever created to torture the rest of us. Create more work and drive everyone up the wall. 

I have put up wth her B.S. for over two years now because the pay is good and my job is union so it's kind of a no brainer. It's a difficult job and it can be highly stressful and demanding.  I'm just doing my very best. I work hard and I am dedicated. 

To get to the point, our office building decided to do a door decorating contest (optional). I wasn't even going to do it but then I spoke to a co-worker in another department and she inspired me to make something fun and creative. I decided what the hell...I'll have some with it. I drew up an idea and decided on Snoopy and Woodstock Christmas theme and the classic Charlie Brown Christmas tree. Who doesn't love those characters?! 

I was super stoked about it and spent my lunch break buying craft materials and some decorations.  I probably spent a little more than I should but most of it could be reused and extra for other projects. Whatever.  I spent at least two hours total shopping and gathering everything.  I was just having fun and being creative which my job doesn't really allow for. 

Come this morning, I load up a massive bag of Christmas door decorations and am ready to take this on first thing. I drag this massive bag up the stairs to the second floor and I just about fell over when I saw my boss way down the hall at my office space door. She was scotch taping those individually wrapped candy canes to the door in a half hazardly fashion above a ripped and rather sad piece of ugly wrapping paper.  She had essentially come in super early and threw up a bunch of cheap crap to the door. She never bothered to ASK myself or the others whether WE were doing anything and if we wanted her to do it. 

Important note: She does NOT work in the office. She is usually not even around. She typically stays at an entirely different location and floats around when there are meetings. She DOES NOT have a space in that room. I work near two other people who I asked if it were cool to take this project on and they gave me a thumbs up. I actually communicated with others and didn't just assume it was mine. 

I was so devastated and angry that I walked past her without a word and threw my stuff down near my desk. It was really obvious that I had this giant bag of decorations and I just tossed it to the floor. Right there and then, I turned around to just get away from her so I strode by her and said without looking at her 

""Go ahead. It's not like i don't spend most of *my* time in this place. Thanks for asking"". 

I walked down the hall and out the front door. I had to get away from her or else I would have just lost it. I was so upset. She doesn't consider anyone else. She just takes over. What bothers me more is that she thought throwing some horrible crap on OUR door would suffice for ""our department "". As far as I was concerned,  it was not for supervisors to do but for staff. People like myself and others to be creative and share in the fun. I felt like she just robbed me of something and took all the joy out of the holidays.  

I guess I have a lot of extra decorations for my home. I'm sure as hell not doing my project now. The moment and inspiration is long gone. She stole this from me. I feel like she just disregards everyone else and acts like we're incapable of having an opinion or doing anything outside of our jobs. I mean wtf was that? She is absolutely useless and gets paid 100K a year. Hardly makes me want to go out of my way just to be steamrolled again.

Now don’t get me wrong, charity is quite important and I’ve made donations and have volunteered for various things throughout my life.

But it hits different this year. Our union contract was up for renewal, and despite our best efforts, we got a measly 3% cost of living adjustment. Yes, I know lots of people don’t get COLAs at all. This 3% was in spite of the fact that we already knew at the time that this was less than the ~4.5% that inflation was being predicted to be, which we now know is over 6%.  This is aside from the fact that I’m already paid around 10% less than market for my position when compared to the same position in other areas with MUCH lower CPI. 

Yet this company is **still** prodding us **daily** to make donations. I really want to reply-all to one of these emails and tell **everyone** in the organization how tone-deaf it is of our employer to nickel and dime us on a COLA, resulting in what is effectively a -3% raise, then constantly pestering us about donating money to those *they* perceive to be “in need”.

"4976"	12	6	"Inspired by what I've seen on this subreddit, I wanted to offer a first-hand example of what a union can do for workers at a company.

After I graduated from college I landed a job at one of the big three car companies in Michigan, as an engineer. I wasn't in the union, but the UAW represents a large portion of the company's employees so my benefits were built largely on what the union could negotiate. The union wins $1, the engineers get $1.10.

***Day 1, here was my package:***

\-$77,000 in salary, which isn't anything extravagant but Michigan is a pretty low-cost state.

\-**3 weeks paid vacation** the day I started, with **an extra week** in December and at least **9 extra days** off sprinkled throughout the year (Labor day, voting day, the day before and after Easter, etc). Every year you get an additional week off for a maximum of **6 weeks**, NOT counting the extra week in December and other days off. 

\-**Sick days whenever I needed them**. If anyone was sick for an extended period of time there's a special program, but if I felt burned out and needed a day off I had no problem taking it. Just let send an email in the morning saying I'm not feeling good; show up the next day and no guilt, no trouble, no worries.

\-Automatic contribution to 401k of 4%, with an additional 4% match if you contribute at least 6% personally. **Essentially, an 8% contribution.** 

\-Health insurance for about $125 a month (myself and spouse). 

\-**$1,500** a year placed into my Health Savings Account (as long as a got a checkup).

\-Yearly raises of at least 2.5% but not uncommon to get **5%,** if you've done well. 

\-**Yearly bonus of around 10% of your base salary**. This varied based on how well you did and how well the company performed overall but was pretty reliable.

I set my Linkedin to open to work to see what’s out there and I have gotten absolutely bombarded with so much garbage. This also goes for HR/hiring. I really don’t know how much of this is recruiters doing what is mandated by their company/management but tell your bosses to stop.  

1. Put the salary in the job description or it will be ignored. Be transparent. Don’t waste my time or yours. 

2. Tell me what you can do for me. Why would I leave my current job for someone who is going to tell me everything they expect of me without giving me an idea of what they plan to do for me (in terms of benefits and career growth) Even if someone is between jobs why should they choose you when they have tons of other choices? You need to sell yourself not the other way around. There is a labor shortage and labor (especially skilled) has a ton of leverage and choices. Be straightforward with what is expected. A lot of places overdo it with inflated language on the job description when the job is pretty simple and a lot can be learned on the job. 

3. Using the word “rockstar” or pushing a company culture. No one gives a fuck. What are the salary expectation’s and benefits. The connotation with “rockstar” is underpaid and overworked.

4. Go remote or go home. Join the idea of work-life balance or GTFO of my inbox. 

5. Decent benefits. Updated to not include PTO but rather rather least a month of paid vacation, a 4 day workweek, 401k, a good health insurance policy."	"2021-12-11 03:44:11"

Just feeling incredibly pissed off and gotta share the experience to see if anyone else thinks this was fucked up.

Started a new job at a car parts store in late October.  Im not a Mechanic, and I really get troubled with nonstandard stuff like farm equipment and some recreational vehicle stuff.  But I thought I was doing good.  I had some good coworkers to pick the brains of if I ever got stumped with something.  And I really enjoyed the place.  It was a business that recentley sold out and had a new owner, but some (most?) of the staff were still there.

All of a sudden as im getting ready to leave for the weekend (I was supposed to work tommorow)  my boss tells me to hang back.  and very abruptly tells me

""Thats it... I gotta let you go.   things are really on the downturn around here (Business is very slow),   you're not gonna be a good fit.   But the door is always open..""

My first reaction was to ask why.  when he just sat there silentley I asked him if it was something I did, or didnt do.  and he just said ""yeah kind of a little of both.  I know I didnt train you at all and thats on me""

So basically what he told me is.  I'm laying you off because minimum wage is increasing, we arent doing well, and i cant afford to keep you,  but im also firing you because you arent going to work out here as an employee... but the door is always open.  what the fuck does that mean?.

And no, I didnt get any training. Id get a crash course in how to use their point of sale system,  and I was shown a few things about where some stuff goes when stocking or picking.  and that was it.  anything else I had to learn from observing my coworkers.   And there was clear evidence that the old co-workers way of doing things, and the way the new boss wanted things done,  Were way off one another. I tried to please everybody, at the end of the day the boss signs the check, so I'd default to his orders.  but the thing was, he never showed me how he wanted things done. and was never around to explain or train..

I think I have stockholm syndrome.  I really liked the job, and I felt like I was getting my life on track. But I think the place might be destined for a quick death,  maybe my boss is an idiot too. I dont know., I liked everyone there.  but that was an extreme douchebag move to pull on me

I sent him a text afterward, apologizing for just kind of walking out abruptly after our brief exchange,  I was very upset because it was a bombshell dropped on me,  and asked him if he could give me some clarification on what the reason was.  he just said he'll send me something in writing.  the 2IC who I was supposed to work with tommorow, I sent a text to, telling him that I was let go,  but he was a pleasure to work with,  told him I didnt know why.  and he suggested it was because of money..  I dont fucking know, other than that im back at square 1.  


  
Edit: Still havent got the official termination or dismissal notice.  But stopped at the shop today to pick up my things and spoke with both of my counter co-workers, the senior one again said that he thinks it was just money reasons. the owner's father is a 10% owner in the business,  and he overheard them talking about cutting hours (and the father probably told him to cut his staff too)

So, we decided, well, lets just slowly stop doing them and try and transfer everyone over to using the online system, since... since working here, I don't think we've ever even referenced one sticky note? (they get thrown in the trash at the end of the month! What a waste of paper!!)

On top of all that, I've also been put in areas at work that I'm comfortable doing with the limitations my back has. It's been unbelievable. I've had those shitty jobs before. I've had terrible managers. I've walked out on more jobs than I'd like to admit for no other reason than the company treats you like dogshit. I understand, but there are good companies and great managers out there. I'm being paid more than what I need for a livable wage and having my needs met thoroughly. What I'm trying to say here is, there are wonderful places to work out there. I promise. It sucks seeing all these posts about horrible work conditions because I've been there too many times to count. But just keep looking, keep believing and you'll find the place that makes you happy. Some of you are probably wondering where I work. Would you believe me if I said Walmart? Because it's true. I still can't believe it myself. THIS is how companies should act. I've felt nothing less than a valued part of the team being here. It's insane."	"2021-12-11 03:37:33"

"4996"	6	3	"Job hunting sucks, browsing on here makes it seem that most jobs also suck. My problem is that they make the hiring process either really short and you know the job is gonna suck or they make the process ridiculously long and it feels like a waste. 

For example; I've been in the hiring process with a medical company to get back in my field for a month and a half; and that's short compared to some of the others I've been through. I've got shit to do and not wait around on these companies for that kind of time. I usually end up ghosting or sending them a sugar coated fuck you by email. 

I'll find a job and in the beginning it will be alright, then slowly but surely you start noticing the cues and it's like a toxic relationship; in bloom. The thing that really gets me is that I don't care about money, I mainly want the benefits because I have meds and health issues to deal with. 

The number one thing, to me, is that quitting a job shouldn't affect my quality of life. That is an absolutely garbage way of pushing people under, who are already treading water. Quitting a job shouldn't threaten my ability to receive healthcare, I didn't ask for this shit. It shouldn't make me starve, end up turning my water, and lights, and furnace off. I don't want to be in this fucking rat race where it's work or die. 

The whole American mindset on having a job is way too ""Work will set you free"" for me. 

I have a dog, a child, a house that is still a shitshow. When I moved in here there was no heat, no bathroom, one outlet, I've had to exhaust myself to make progress and I can't do that and exhaust myself at work. I have no want for any of this anymore."	"2021-12-11 03:36:24"
"4997"	13	3	"Hey y’all, I posted a few days ago about how my boss wanted to meet with me after work for whatever reason. Here’s an update:

I waited for fifteen minutes and she didn’t show up. I texted and called her and got no answer on either. I went home and I don’t plan to talk to her tonight. She is spamming me with calls but I’m not going to answer cause I’m off work and I don’t care anymore. We scheduled this meeting a week ago and she knew it was tonight at 5:00pm. I waited until 5:15, went to two places, and she wasn’t at either. I’ve done way more than I should’ve.

I’m done."	"2021-12-11 03:35:51"

He partnered with his brother Will, the sanitarium’s bookkeeper, to make and sell them to the public. Will had less interest in dietary purity and more business sense than his brother, and worried that the products wouldn’t sell as they were. He wanted to add sugar to the flakes to make them more palatable, but John wouldn’t hear of it. Will eventually started selling the cereals through his own business, which became the Kellogg Company”…. - [source](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/32042/corn-flakes-were-invented-part-anti-masturbation-crusade)"	"2021-12-11 03:33:28"
